Washington, DC -- "This decision marks a dramatic departure from four decades of Supreme Court rulings that upheld a woman's right to choose and recognized the importance of women's health. Today's decision blatantly defies the Court's recent decision in 2000 striking down a state partial-birth abortion law because of its failure to provide an exception for the health of the mother. As the Supreme Court recognized in Roe v. Wade in 1973, this issue is complex and highly personal; the rights and lives of women must be taken into account. It is precisely this erosion of our constitutional rights that I warned against when I opposed the nominations of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito."
"Today, too few women know about emergency contraception because many doctors, hospitals and pharmacists are not providing women with the information they need to understand and access it," said Senator Murray. "By raising awareness of the availability of emergency contraception we will help protect women's reproductive health, reduce unintended pregnancies and decrease the number of abortions."
"Greater awareness of and access to EC helps women prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce the need for abortions in the United States; a goal on which we can all agree" Rep. Slaughter said. "EC has been available over the counter for women 18 and older for more than a year now. Yet, barriers to information and access still prevent many women from obtaining and appropriately using EC. We can and must do more to overcome these challenges and ensure women are empowered to make knowledgeable decisions about the reproductive health."
Emergency contraception is a concentrated dose of ordinary birth control that can dramatically reduce a woman's chance of becoming pregnant if taken soon after sex. Emergency contraception does not cause abortion; rather it prevents pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation, fertilization, or implantation before a pregnancy occurs. Emergency contraception is safe and effective, and last year the FDA approved over-the-counter sales of the medication for individuals ages 18 and up. Senator Murray and Senator Clinton played a critical role in getting the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide that approval after long delays by placing a hold on the Bush Administration's nominee for FDA Administrator.
Each year 3 million pregnancies, or one-half of all pregnancies in the United States, are unintended. Half of these end in abortion. If emergency contraception is taken within 72 hours after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure, it can reduce the risk of pregnancy by as much 89 percent.
Addressing the Disproportionate Impact of HIV Among Women - Worldwide, adult women account for almost half of all new infections, and in certain areas, like sub-Saharan Africa, women account for more than 60% of those living with HIV. As President, Hillary Clinton will work to reduce infections among women, improve their access to care and treatment, and give them the tools needed to protect themselves against infection. She will require our government to develop a comprehensive plan to address the needs of girls and women and integrate these needs into our efforts to address HIV/AIDS. This plan will identify and address factors, such as gender-based violence and economic insecurity, which are linked with increased vulnerability to HIV. It will also work to improve services for women, in order to integrate HIV and AIDS care into existing health service delivery, including sexual and reproductive health services and family planning. In addition to working to ensure that the health needs of women are addressed in our global AIDS policies, Hillary Clinton will also improve access to overall women's health services that help provide treatment, care and education. She would restore U.S. funding for UNFPA, which provides vital reproductive health services to women around the world, and rescind the Global Gag Rule, which prevents U.S. funding from assisting nongovernmental organizations in other countries that provide information about or access to abortion services.
* Present, Present, Present, Present, Present, Present, Present: As a State Senator, Barack Obama voted 'present' on seven choice bills, including a ban on 'partial birth abortion,' two parental notification laws and three 'born alive' bills. In each case, the right vote was clear, but Senator Obama chose political cover over standing and fighting for his convictions.

* Obama "Present" Excuse Doesn't Hold: The Obama campaign is trying to explain the IL Senator's present votes by suggesting that abortion-rights groups encouraged IL state lawmakers to vote present but few of the other Democrats who voted "present" on abortion bills recall such a strategy.

In the question of women's health, Sen. Clinton remains pro-choice, but she also champions a plan that would promote education, adoption and foster parenting for children of unwanted pregnancies as an alternative to abortion.
Specifically, the article says that while Obama was previously "flatly opposed to capital punishment, in support of a federal single-payer health plan, against any restrictions on abortion, and in support of state laws to ban the manufacture, sale and even possession of handguns," he has since been criticized for "abandon[ing] the stands as he rose through the ranks." The article notes that "Obama, who makes an issue of his opponents' consistency in the presidential race, has tempered many of those 1996 views during his quick rise to the pinnacle of American politics."
Health care, national defense, the Iraq war, and a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. That is an issue not much discussed now, but there are candidates who are clearly not pro-choice and who would do their best to ensure that the Supreme Court has the votes to overturn Roe v. Wade.
She would lift the gag rule prohibiting international family planning programs from counseling poor women about abortion.

"On the 35th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I am reaffirming my commitment to safe, legal, and rare abortion, and unveiling an agenda for decreasing the number of unintended pregnancies in the U.S. through honest and complete sex education and expanded access to contraception and family planning," said Clinton.
Hillary has been a leading advocate for the right of every woman to make the most personal of life decisions for years. She believes the right to privacy is a fundamental right, and that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. Her views on reproductive rights were informed by seeing what happens when the government gets involved in these decisions. As First Lady, Hillary traveled to Romania where, under a Soviet-style dictatorship, the government had controlled every aspect of women's reproductive health by eliminating birth control, sex education and abortion and requiring humiliating government-controlled monthly exams, in order to compel every woman to bear five children and build the Romanian state. Hillary saw the other extreme in China, with its one birth policy, under which women could be sterilized or forced to have an abortion if they got pregnant for a second time. Hillary took those lessons to heart.
Appointing Justices that will uphold the right to privacy - Senator Clinton opposed the nominations of Justices Alito and Roberts to the Supreme Court because she believed they represented the greatest threat to Roe since it was decided. Her prediction has been born out through Gonzales v. Carhart, the first time the Supreme Court upheld a law outlawing a specific abortion procedure. As President, Hillary will nominate justices who share her view that the Constitution protects a woman's right to make the most fundamental decisions about her life and health, and that the right to privacy is a fundamental right.
Enacting the Freedom of Choice Act - Hillary will sign into law the Freedom of Choice Act, which would codify Roe v. Wade and send a renewed signal to the courts that the will of Congress and the President is to keep abortion legal.
Hillary has long believed that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. Unfortunately, we are far from realizing that vision. One half of pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended and one half of unintended pregnancies end in abortion, and the U.S. has one of the highest rates of teen pregnancy in the industrialized world. Hillary's agenda will help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies by:
"At a time when states across the country are proposing and passing laws that limit reproductive rights and some that immediately criminalize abortion should Roe v. Wade be overturned; at a time when the US Supreme Court has launched a direct attack on Roe v. Wade, by completely disregarding 30 years of legal precedent, and—for the first time ever—voting to uphold a ban nationwide on a medically safe and necessary abortion procedure—a ban that contains no exception for the health of a woman: we need a leader who counts women's health among her top priorities.
And as some of you've heard me discuss before, I think abortion should remain legal, but it needs to be safe and rare.
Some of you know, I went to China in 1995 and spoke out against the Chinese government's one-child policy, which led to forced abortions and forced sterilization because I believed that we needed to bear witness against what was an intrusive, abusive, dehumanizing effort to dictate how women and men would proceed with respect to the children they wished to have.
And then shortly after that, I was in Romania and there I met women who had been subjected to the communist regime of the 1970s and '80s where they were essentially forced to bear as many children as possible for the good of the state. And where abortion was criminalized and women were literally forced to have physical exams and followed by the secret police and so many children were abandoned and left to the orphanages that, unfortunately, led to an AIDS epidemic.
During his first run for elected office, Barack Obama played a greater role than his aides now acknowledge in crafting liberal stands on gun control, the death penalty and abortion - positions that appear at odds with the more moderate image he has projected during his presidential campaign.
What this is about is the fact that some of the Planned Parenthood facilities perform abortions, which is legal under the laws of the United States.
If they want to shut down the legal provision of abortion services, then they've got a bigger problem, because, obviously, they—Planned Parenthood does not use federal dollars to do that.
Or having an abortion.
Ted Cruz wants to be president (and he's got as much of a shot as any of the Republican candidates). But he not only refuses to face the truth that women's health and rights are under attack in this country -- he has a long record of trying to limit access to birth control (and ban abortion, and cut women off from preventive care). That's what's at stake in 2016.
"I am honored to earn the endorsement of NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC. As one of our country's leading advocates for reproductive rights, NARAL's work is more important than ever. Women's health and rights are under attack across America. In Texas, state leaders are taking their fight to cut women off from access to safe and legal abortion all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Colorado Springs, a violent extremist targeted a health center. Meanwhile, Congress has voted to restrict reproductive rights and cut women off from access to affordable health care. And one after another, Republicans running for President have pledged to cut funding for Planned Parenthood; restrict abortion access; and repeal the Affordable Care Act, which ensures that women will no longer be charged more just for being women.
"In January 2017, a new President will walk into the Oval Office. We cannot afford to elect a Republican who will rip away the progress women have made. We need to protect and advance reproductive rights, not allow politicians to interfere in women's personal health decisions. I will stand with NARAL and women across the country in defending access to abortion, contraception, and sex education. I will stand with NARALin advocating for policies that help women and families. The stakes could not be higher in this election, and I am grateful to the more than 1 million members of NARAL for their support."
Last year alone, Republicans in Congress voted numerous times to chip away at women's reproductive rights. And Republican presidential candidates are on the same mission: Every single one of them supports efforts to restrict women's access to safe and legal abortion, and some even oppose abortion in cases of rape, incest, or to protect a woman's health.
In other words: If Congress sends a bill restricting women's reproductive rights to a Republican president, you can bet he or she will sign it—and with as many as four Supreme Court seats opening up within the next president's term in office, the right to safe and legal abortion itself could hang in the balance.
"We need a president who has what it takes to stop Republicans from defunding Planned Parenthood and taking away a woman's right to basic health care. If I'm elected, I will be that president. I've fought for women and families my entire life, and I refuse to let anyone rip away the progress we've made. I will defend against attacks on reproductive health care, and protect access to affordable contraception and safe and legal abortion across the country. I will fight to ensure access to reproductive health care regardless of income, national origin, race, or ZIP code. And I will be a champion for women and families—just as Planned Parenthood has been for nearly a century."
They recently sat down together with Refinery29 and talked about everything from "mansplaining" to the future of abortion rights and why Hillary is Planned Parenthood's presidential pick.
"More than ever, women need more than a vote or a supportive statement; we need a fighter in the White House who will put women and families at the front of the agenda. We face unprecedented attacks from candidates who seek to create a country where our daughters have fewer rights than we do now. As a senator, Hillary Clinton introduced eight separate bills to advance women's reproductive rights—eight more than anyone running. As secretary of state, she helped advance the status of women and girls around the world and confronted human rights abuses. And as a candidate she has put issues important to women on the front burner—like equal pay, overturning the Hyde Amendment, and ensuring patients can continue to come to Planned Parenthood. She has stood up for access to safe and legal abortion and will stand up to every attempt to roll back the rights generations have fought to earn. That's the kind of champion women deserve."
The right to safe and legal abortion is on the line—a Republican president would make sure of it.
When the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade on January 22, 1973, it recognized that the U.S. Constitution protects a woman's right to safe and legal abortion. It's a decision that has withstood 43 years of politically motivated attacks in the courts, in Congress, by state legislatures, and at the hands of violent extremists.
Over the past five years, states have enacted 288 abortion restrictions (and counting). That's more than the previous 15 years combined.
These restrictions—which keep abortion access out of reach for many women and even shutter clinics altogether—undermine women's fundamental rights and health.
Let's be very clear about one thing: The onslaught of attacks on these rights is not a coincidence; it's part of a deliberate strategy to chip away at the right to abortion altogether, until the Supreme Court has the chance to eviscerate the decision.
That may come sooner than you think: An abortion case the Court will hear later this year from Texas, Whole Women's Health v. Cole, is the biggest challenge to Roe we've seen in a generation—one that would be devastating to women in Texas and could significantly affect reproductive rights across the country.
Just imagine the damage a Republican president could do. Marco Rubio has said he will appoint justices that will overturn Roe v. Wade. Ted Cruz has referred to today as "the dark anniversary of Roe v. Wade." Ben Carson said he would "love" to see the decision overturned. All three of them would support a ban on abortion—even in cases of rape or incest.
At an event with NARAL Pro-Choice America and NARAL New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton reminded the crowd that abortion rights aren't only a health issue—they're also an economic issue. 
Here's an incredible sentence: A federal judge has ruled that a mandate requiring abortion providers in Louisiana to have admitting privileges at hospitals within 30 miles of their clinics is unconstitutional.
To put it in simpler terms: Right now, the state of Louisiana has six licensed abortion providers. If this law had been upheld, that number would have dropped to two.
Laws like this are popping up all over the country, all with one purpose: to eliminate access to safe and legal abortion, or make a constitutional right a privilege only for those who can afford it. And this year, the Supreme Court will rule on the constitutionality of a similar law in my home state of Texas that amounts to the biggest challenge to Roe v. Wade in a generation.
Every woman has the right to safe and legal abortion. Louisiana lawmakers may have forgotten that—but thankfully, a federal judge didn't.
Senator Marco Rubio claimed that on the question of abortion that you support abortion on baby's due date. What do you say to that?
5 And right now, a case from Texas could determine whether the right to abortion will be a reality for all or some. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016
In an election where the Republican candidates for president have repeatedly made insulting, offensive comments about women—and put forward policies to match—Donald Trump lived up to his name this week. In an interview with MSNBC, he said that abortion should be illegal—and there would "have to be some form of punishment" for women who have an abortion.
Earlier this month, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a Texas case that could have sweeping implications for women's ability to access safe and legal abortion across the country—not only today, but for generations to come. Here, four women take on the complex issue of abortion, Donald Trump's comments, the potential impact of the Texas case, and the importance of protecting women's health and rights in the upcoming presidential election.
The stakes are especially high for women if we let one of those guys into office—Trump's outrageous comments are proof of that. In case you missed it, he said abortion should be illegal, and if a woman gets one, "there has to be some sort of punishment."
He also made sure to point out that the only way abortion will be outlawed in America is if we elect a president like him who'll appoint anti-choice judges.
During his time in office, Governor Perry attacked women's health and Planned Parenthood. He cut funding for preventive care and screenings, and signed laws like the demeaning mandatory ultrasound bill, which forced women seeking an abortion in Texas to undergo a medically unnecessary ultrasound, whether they wanted to or not. And he signed House Bill 2, one of the nation's toughest abortion restrictions—after saying that his ultimate goal was to make access to abortion at any stage "a thing of the past."
Law and policy aren't abstract issues or cheap campaign fodder. They affect people's lives every day, in big and small ways, for better or worse. And when candidates like Donald Trump call for criminalizing abortion, it matters.
Trump may be leading the race to the bottom when it comes to women's health and rights, but he's far from the only contestant. In the last five years alone, lawmakers across the country have enacted 231 restrictions on abortion. These restrictions put quality, affordable reproductive health care even further out of reach for women who already face the greatest obstacles to getting the care they need. It's a vicious cycle.
At a time when we should be doing everything we can to break down barriers that hold people back and build ladders of opportunity in their place, laws like these build even more hurdles for many already living on the margins and contribute to a culture of shame and stigma around abortion. And Donald Trump has made it clear that he would erect even more barriers—condemning us to a future in which the health care women need slips further and further out of reach every day.
All of the Republican frontrunners for president want to make abortion illegal. Now Donald Trump has said how he'd enforce that prohibition: punishing women and doctors.
But it's important to remember that he's not alone. Donald Trump is just saying what Republican politicians across the country believe—everyone who has signed and voted for laws to defund Planned Parenthood, force women to undergo invasive and medically unnecessary procedures before ending a pregnancy, mandate that doctors recite misleading information to patients, and shutter every abortion provider for miles. These are laws that are meant to shame women and block their access to health care. That's their purpose.
Right now, the Supreme Court is weighing whether a Texas law imposing unnecessary, expensive requirements on doctors who perform abortions will be allowed to stand. It's the biggest challenge to Roe v. Wade in a generation. There are so few abortion providers in Texas that getting an abortion can mean taking time off work, finding child care, driving halfway across a state the size of France, and spending a night in a hotel—any one of these things many women simply can't afford. If the Supreme Court rules that this law is constitutional, there could be just 10 abortion providers left in all of Texas—a place that 5.4 million women of reproductive age call home.
If you have to jump through multiple hoops to access a right, it's like not having that right at all. It's a privilege for the wealthy. And when politicians put up barriers that make it all but impossible for low-income women to get an abortion, they're jeopardizing women's health, economic security, and futures. That's just plain wrong.
Reproductive health and rights are a fundamental part of women's health and rights. And reproductive health includes abortion. So defending women's health and rights means defending access to abortion—not just in principle but in practice.
We need to repeal laws like the Hyde Amendment that make it harder for low-income women, and disproportionately women of color, to exercise their full reproductive rights. We need to fight against the erosion of rights at the state level, where Republicans have signed laws designed to shame and coerce women and defund Planned Parenthood. We need to ensure that patients and staff are safe to walk into health centers without facing harassment, bullying, or violence. And we must always, always stand with the brave women and men across our country who are as committed as ever to providing safe and legal abortion care, even in places where that right is under concerted attack.
The Supreme Court recently held oral arguments from an abortion case from Texas—and the state's access to safe and legal abortion hangs in the balance. Every leading Republican presidential candidate opposes abortion, and some even oppose exceptions for rape, incest, or to protect a woman's health. And many would overturn Roe v. Wade to make that happen.
By now you've probably heard the news: Donald Trump said he believes women should receive "some form of punishment" for seeking an abortion.
1. As governor of Ohio, John Kasich has restricted abortion access: He signed into law a ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy—which didn't include exceptions for rape, incest, or a woman's life. He defunded Planned Parenthood in Ohio, cutting more than $1 million in funding for health screenings and HIV testing. And because of restrictions he's signed into law, the only two abortion providers in southwest Ohio could soon close—making it that much harder for nearly half a million Ohio women to exercise their constitutional right.
2. Donald Trump promised that he would shut down the government rather than fund Planned Parenthood, which provides vital health care including birth control, cancer screenings, and yes—safe and legal abortion.
4. As with all attacks on abortion access, 20-week bans are part of a deliberate, coordinated effort to chip away at women's constitutional right to safe and legal abortion. Abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy are extremely rare but often take place under serious and complex circumstances—at a time when women and their doctors need every medical option available.
Today, following the Supreme Court's decision in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, which struck down some of the country's most restrictive anti-abortion measures, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"The Supreme Court's decision in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt is a victory for women across America. By striking down politically motivated restrictions that made it nearly impossible for Texans to exercise their full reproductive rights, the Court upheld every woman's right to safe, legal abortion, no matter where she lives.
"Our fight is far from over. In Texas and across the country, a woman's constitutional right to make her own health decisions is under attack. In the first three months of 2016, states introduced more than 400 measures restricting access to abortion. We've seen a concerted, persistent attack on women's health and rights at the federal level. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has said women should be punished for having abortions. He also pledged to defund Planned Parenthood and appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade.
"Today's decision is a reminder of how much is at stake in this election. We need a President who will defend women's health and rights and appoint Supreme Court justices who recognize Roe v. Wade as settled law. We must continue to protect access to safe and legal abortion – not just on paper, but in reality."
Health care, national defense, the Iraq war, and a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. That is an issue not much discussed now, but there are candidates who are clearly not pro-choice and who would do their best to ensure that the Supreme Court has the votes to overturn Roe v. Wade.
"We need a president who has what it takes to stop Republicans from defunding Planned Parenthood and taking away a woman's right to basic health care. If I'm elected, I will be that president. I've fought for women and families my entire life, and I refuse to let anyone rip away the progress we've made.

President Bush's recent budget proposal drastically reduces funding for the Medicaid program, and fails to increase funding for Title X, our national family planning program. The program provides low-income women and their significant others with contraception for family planning purposes. Senator Clinton's legislation called the Unintended Pregnancy Reduction Act of 2007 has the potential to counteract the budget cuts and significantly reduce the high rate of unintended pregnancies and abortions in the United States by allowing for contraception coverage under Medicaid.
Clinton first introduced the legislation during the last Congress. She's continually advocated for legislation in the Senate that would reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, preventing abortions and improving women's health.
During his first run for elected office, Barack Obama played a greater role than his aides now acknowledge in crafting liberal stands on gun control, the death penalty and abortion - positions that appear at odds with the more moderate image he has projected during his presidential campaign.
