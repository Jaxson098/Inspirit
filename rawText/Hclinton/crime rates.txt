"Senator Clinton is a tremendous supporter of the COPS program," Willis said. "The COPS program put more police on our streets, gave our officers the equipment they need, and in the long run, it made our communities safer. For the last six and a half years we've seen that program cut, year after year. And what has happened? Our crime rates across the country are going up. Senator Clinton will give local elected officials the tools they need to make our communities safer."
Dinkins, New York City's first African-American Mayor, served as the 106th Mayor of the City of New York from 1990 to 1994. Among his many accomplishments was the institution of the widely praised "Safe Streets, Safe City" program, which hired thousands of new police officers and began the decline of crime rates in New York City. He established a system of after-school youth centers, Beacon Schools, and opened several Community Health Centers. Dinkins also led the fight to divest the City's $500 million dollars in pension funds invested in companies that did business with apartheid South Africa and worked to create an all civilian Police Oversight Board to review misconduct complaints.
As the foreclosures mount, the housing crisis is also becoming a municipal crisis. Cities and towns face the prospect of blight, higher crime rates, vacant properties marring neighborhoods, cutting tax receipts, and dragging down property values.
The housing crisis is also a crisis for our cities, our towns and our neighborhoods. At least 41 million homes will lose value because of foreclosures in their neighborhoods, including 1.7 million homes right here in Pennsylvania. Abandoned homes and boarded up neighborhoods mean higher crime rates, lower property values, and plummeting tax receipts for cities and towns across America. Now, a year ago in March 2007 I called for immediate action to address abuses in the subprime market, and I laid out detailed concrete proposals for how to do so. I warned this administration that the problems in subprime mortgages would soon spill over into regular mortgages. The response from our president? Well, his Treasury Secretary told Congress that the problem was, quote, "contained." And president himself assured us there would be a, quote, "soft landing for the housing market." The housing crisis then spread from subprime to traditional mortgages. And in August of last year, I warned the administration that the housing mortgage crisis would soon ripple out throughout the entire economy. Again, I called for immediate action and laid out concrete proposals to prevent foreclosures and help states hard hit by this crisis.
