Currently, 1 in 3 women are unaware of emergency contraception; Murray, Clinton, Slaughter bill would initiate a large-scale education campaign
Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY) introduced Senate legislation that will raise awareness about the availability of emergency contraception also known as Plan B or the "morning-after" pill. The bill authorizes an education campaign to better inform women and healthcare providers of emergency contraception. Representative Louise Slaughter (D-NY) has already introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.
The program would provide a description of emergency contraception and an explanation of its use, safety, efficacy and availability to nonprofit organizations, consumer groups, institutions of higher education, Federal, State, or local agencies, clinics and the media.
The Clinton campaign unveiled its plan to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the U.S. and around the world. The comprehensive approach addresses the multiple challenges that HIV/AIDS has presented for over 25 years and includes investments for increased research, prevention and education, and access to treatment and other services. Hillary's plan would especially help groups in the U.S. that have seen HIV infection rates rise over the past several years, including African Americans and gay men, and address the continued risk in Latino communities and among women. In addition, Clinton has pledged to increase funding for the global HIV/AIDS fight to at least $50 billion by 2013.
"In many ways, our fight against HIV/AIDS is at a crossroads. While we have made progress in education and developing medicine that keeps those living with HIV/AIDS healthier, we need to be vigilant in ensuring that people are getting the information and care they need," said Clinton. "I believe with leadership and smart investments we can significantly reduce the number of new infections, develop treatments that turn HIV/AIDS into a chronic but manageable condition, and expand toward an eventual vaccine."
On the domestic front, Clinton proposes doubling the HIV/AIDS research budget within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to $5.2 billion annually, including the U.S. contribution towards finding a vaccine. Clinton's American Health Choices Plan will ensure that all Americans living with HIV/AIDS have access to care. Hillary will end the Bush administration's abstinence-only prevention policy, and instead, fund evidence-based HIV/AIDS prevention programs including, but not limited to, abstinence education as part of a comprehensive prevention message.
This plan builds on Hillary's long history of working to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. As Senator, Hillary has introduced legislation to expand access to treatment for low-income individuals living with HIV; pushed to make scientific, evidence-based prevention programs more available to youth; sought to increase coordination in combating global AIDS; championed legislation to provide universal basic education that would help prevent the spread of AIDS, and consistently supported increased funding for federal efforts against the epidemic both in the U.S. and around the world.
Increasing Funding for Evidence-Based Prevention Efforts - As President, Hillary will work to give individuals the tools needed to protect themselves against HIV by supporting proven strategies and targeting those efforts to the populations most vulnerable to HIV infection. Hillary supports giving young people age-appropriate information about HIV/AIDS and how to protect themselves against the disease, including by delaying sexual activity. But she rejects the Bush Administration approach of investing exclusively in abstinence-only sex education. She supports federal funding for needle exchange programs. And she will work to target culturally competent prevention efforts towards vulnerable populations that account for a disproportionate number of new infections. In addition, she will ensure that women, who account for more than one-quarter of all new HIV/AIDS infections in the U.S., have the knowledge and tools necessary to protect themselves against HIV.
Addressing High Risk Behaviors That Often Lead to HIV/AIDS - Hillary will work to halt and reverse the recent increase in infection rates among gay men, young people, and people of color. In addition, Hillary will seek to address the factors that contribute to high risk behavior, such as the use of drugs like crystal meth, which is impacting both rural and urban areas, and the use of which is on the rise in the gay community. Hillary was a proud co-sponsor of the Combat Meth Act of 2005, which was signed into law on March 9, 2006. This law tightens restrictions on how pseudoephedrine is sold to ensure that it is not being trafficked, and provides resources for prevention, education, and treatment. As President, Hillary will work to see that this law is implemented effectively.
Expanding Prevention Efforts and Targeted Outreach - Hillary wants to maximize the impact of new U.S. funding in prevention efforts at the local level. She believes that effective prevention models should be tailored to the needs of communities, without requirements that limit the ability to provide accurate information and relevant comprehensive services to as many individuals as possible. To that end, she supports striking the current requirement that 33% of prevention funding be spent on abstinence-only programs, to ensure that prevention efforts can be tailored to local needs and populations most at-risk. She also supports using U.S. funding to support proven harm reduction efforts - including needle exchange - to help hard-to-reach populations, and will continue to support new evidence-based prevention methods as additional scientific research helps us understand how to best address this epidemic. Hillary will also work to support efforts to reduce stigma and improve outreach and education around testing. When people get tested, and they discover they are positive, we can help them access treatment, medical care, and information about the virus before they become sick. If people get tested and they are negative, counselors can help them understand how they can avoid infection.
Championing Universal Basic Education as a "Social Vaccine" to Combat HIV/AIDS - Hillary is the original Senate sponsor of the Education For All Act, which calls for a dramatic increase in US funding and leadership in achieving universal basic education. In addition to reducing poverty and improving child and maternal health, education is a key form of prevention - a "social vaccine"- against the spread of HIV/AIDS. Compared to peers who are out of school, girls enrolled in secondary education are more likely to resist early marriage and remain abstinent, while also being five times more likely to know the basic facts of prevention and three times less likely to contract HIV/AIDS. With strong peer support programs, life skills training, and prevention curricula that address HIV/AIDS, gender-based violence and other health concerns, education can be even more effective in combating HIV/AIDS.
Addressing the Disproportionate Impact of HIV Among Women - Worldwide, adult women account for almost half of all new infections, and in certain areas, like sub-Saharan Africa, women account for more than 60% of those living with HIV. As President, Hillary Clinton will work to reduce infections among women, improve their access to care and treatment, and give them the tools needed to protect themselves against infection. She will require our government to develop a comprehensive plan to address the needs of girls and women and integrate these needs into our efforts to address HIV/AIDS. This plan will identify and address factors, such as gender-based violence and economic insecurity, which are linked with increased vulnerability to HIV. It will also work to improve services for women, in order to integrate HIV and AIDS care into existing health service delivery, including sexual and reproductive health services and family planning. In addition to working to ensure that the health needs of women are addressed in our global AIDS policies, Hillary Clinton will also improve access to overall women's health services that help provide treatment, care and education. She would restore U.S. funding for UNFPA, which provides vital reproductive health services to women around the world, and rescind the Global Gag Rule, which prevents U.S. funding from assisting nongovernmental organizations in other countries that provide information about or access to abortion services.
Sen. Clinton wants to see our children's education grow. She plans to redirect and fully fund No Child Left Behind, the well-known unfunded mandate from the Bush administration. She plans to a take the emphasis away from standardized testing and promote creativity in the classroom. She wants to see more college students go into the field of education and see those teachers be paid in a way that makes them want to stay in the profession.
In the question of women's health, Sen. Clinton remains pro-choice, but she also champions a plan that would promote education, adoption and foster parenting for children of unwanted pregnancies as an alternative to abortion.
The agenda includes preventing unintended pregnancies by increasing access to honest, accurate sex education, contraception and family planning services, ensuring that private health plans offer the same level of coverage for contraception as they do for other prescription drugs and services, ensuring that women who survive sexual assault have access to emergency contraception upon request. Clinton also calls for providing greater access to reproductive health care services overseas.
"On the 35th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I am reaffirming my commitment to safe, legal, and rare abortion, and unveiling an agenda for decreasing the number of unintended pregnancies in the U.S. through honest and complete sex education and expanded access to contraception and family planning," said Clinton.
Hillary has been a leading advocate for the right of every woman to make the most personal of life decisions for years. She believes the right to privacy is a fundamental right, and that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. Her views on reproductive rights were informed by seeing what happens when the government gets involved in these decisions. As First Lady, Hillary traveled to Romania where, under a Soviet-style dictatorship, the government had controlled every aspect of women's reproductive health by eliminating birth control, sex education and abortion and requiring humiliating government-controlled monthly exams, in order to compel every woman to bear five children and build the Romanian state. Hillary saw the other extreme in China, with its one birth policy, under which women could be sterilized or forced to have an abortion if they got pregnant for a second time. Hillary took those lessons to heart.
In the Senate, she has been an outspoken critic of the Bush Administration's relentless and insidious attempts to undermine Roe and has been on the forefront of the major victories on behalf of the pro-choice community in recent years. In the Senate, Hillary waged a three-year effort, along with Senator Patty Murray, to get the FDA to accept the overwhelming recommendation of the medical community and approve emergency contraception for over-the-counter sales. She also helped craft a winning strategy to put the right wing on the defensive by highlighting their opposition to contraception, a position that is way out of the mainstream in the U.S. Hillary championed the Prevention First Act, which expands access to contraception for women of all income levels, and provides for honest and complete sex education programs. As President, Hillary will be vigilant in ensuring that each woman maintains the right to plan her own family and protect her reproductive health.
"In January 2017, a new President will walk into the Oval Office. We cannot afford to elect a Republican who will rip away the progress women have made. We need to protect and advance reproductive rights, not allow politicians to interfere in women's personal health decisions. I will stand with NARAL and women across the country in defending access to abortion, contraception, and sex education. I will stand with NARALin advocating for policies that help women and families. The stakes could not be higher in this election, and I am grateful to the more than 1 million members of NARAL for their support."
"Planned Parenthood has issued its first-ever primary endorsement of Hillary because she's been fighting for women and families her entire life. In Arkansas, she launched the first rape crisis hotline in the state. In the Senate, she fought tirelessly for reproductive rights, access to birth control, and sex education. As secretary of state, women's health and women's rights were the centerpiece of her agenda. All that experience means that Hillary has the skills and the scars that no one else can match. She is the strongest, most qualified candidate for the office of president that I have ever encountered. But in an election, she'll only be as powerful as those who stand with her."
"Her commitment to promoting policies to develop alternative energy technologies and fighting global warming are only two of the many issues in which Hillary has shown her ability to lead. Senator Clinton also has a long record of working on issues that are important to women and to Latino families, such as education, healthcare and economic empowerment. I look forward to working to help elect Hillary the next president of the United States."
Miller served as Governor of the State of Nevada from 1989 to 1999, and is distinguished as the longest serving governor in state history. He served as Chair of both the National Governors Association (1996-7) and the Western Governors Association (1993-4). He also served as Co-Chair of ACHIEVE, NGA's public/private partnership to improve American education. He is a founding member and current Chair of the Past Governors Association.
Miller, who has held several elected offices including Lieutenant Governor and Clark County District Attorney, is known for his leadership and advocacy for education, combating crime and protecting natural resources. During his tenure as governor, he was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.
"Bob is one of the most respected leaders in the country, due to his achievements as Governor of one of the fastest-growing states in the nation, his work in promoting education at all levels and strengthening public safety in our communities, and his leadership among state executives on a national level," said Clinton. I am delighted that he will help to lead our efforts nationally."
Mayor Menino, currently serving his fourth term as the Mayor of Boston, is credited with working to provide every child with a quality education, create affordable housing, lower the crime rate, revitalize Boston's neighborhoods, and promote a healthy lifestyle for all city residents. As President of the United States Conference of Mayors from 2002-2003, he championed homeland security and housing availability.
"Hillary Clinton has devoted her life to helping others," Dinkins said. "From healthcare to education to caring for our veterans, she has been a champion for the millions of Americans who have been invisible to this administration. Her depth of experience and her strength of character make her uniquely suited to be President."
Elected in 1999, Mayor Street launched an ambitious effort called the Neighborhood Transformation Initiative to revitalize local communities by eliminating blight and decayed properties, developing affordable and market-rate housing, and cleaning and securing city streets. Mayor Street also focused on improving the lives of the city's children, forming the Philadelphia Children's Commission, developing after-school programming, supporting education reforms and creating programs to reduce truancy.
Prior to his election as mayor, Street served 20 years on the Philadelphia City Council and was chosen unanimously by its members to serve as president in 1992 and 1996. As Council President, Mayor Street was known for his expertise on a range of issues including city budgeting and fiscal matters, housing, education and crime. Working with then-Mayor Edward G. Rendell, Mayor Street helped craft and implement a financial plan that turned a $250 million deficit into the largest surplus in city history.
In her twelve years in the State Legislature, Sen. Kuehl has authored 160 bills that have been signed into law. She has championed gender-related issues, writing legislation establishing the rights contained in Roe vs. Wade in California statute, strengthening protection for domestic violence victims and their children, and prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender and disability in the workplace and sexual orientation in education. She has also authored legislation establishing paid family leave, overhauling California's child support services system, establishing nurse to patient ratios in every hospital, increasing the rights of crime victims, and safeguarding the environment and drinking water.
Hillary Clinton outlined several key initiatives including her pre-K program and discussed the importance of early education that can help put children on the right path to a successful and productive life.
With respect to violence and re-entry, Hillary Clinton discussed her youth opportunity agenda and the importance of education. Clinton discussed the disproportionate number of men of color who are in prison, and how to ensure that they succeed when they are released. She outlined options including providing more vocational programs that train people who are returning to the workforce. The Senator noted that many industries, such as the auto and airline industry, have a shortage of trained workers and it would be wise to create and expand training programs for people who are unemployed so they can fill positions in these industries.
She also noted weaknesses in the Bush Administration, pointing to how they eliminated education programs in prison that would help people find work after their release, and also how the current administration did not do more to get guns off the street.
"Senator Clinton has an excellent concept about how she plans to address issues surrounding crime and education. She described how she has partnered with leaders in New York to create a charter school specifically for African American men and notes that the Allen Cathedral AME Church charter school in Jamaica Queens, New York could be used as a model of how to help educate African American young men. Her mentioning of the school shows that she's aware of outstanding successful examples of education in this country. The way she addressed the need for the federal government to partner with inner cities suggests that she's not just focusing on international issues but that she's concerned with domestic ones - particularly crime and violence in our communities. I want a president who knows how to strike a balance between addressing international and domestic challenges facing this country," said Reverend Dr. Harold R. Mayberry, Senior Pastor of First African Methodist Episcopal Church and Chairperson of Network for Interfaith Action.
2. Help local school districts pursue voluntary integration and reduce racial inequality, in the face of a reactionary Supreme Court. This past June, the Supreme Court placed severe restrictions on the voluntary efforts of local communities around the country to pursue greater racial equality in education. Four conservative Justices voted to slam the door shut on any meaningful local program designed for this important purpose. A fifth Justice, Justice Kennedy, rejected the voluntary plans of Seattle and Louisville and placed tight constraints on any school district seeking to take steps to redeem the promise of Brown v. Board of Education. But he did not bar these efforts outright. So today, local school districts around the country can choose to implement voluntary programs, but they have to tread very carefully to meet new standards. Hillary believes that the majority was simply wrong in this case. And when she is President, she will appoint Justices who understand the meaning of Brown and the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause. As President, she will also take concrete steps to help local school districts meet the tougher standards imposed by Justice Kennedy and continue their laudable efforts to promote voluntary integration. Specifically, she will:
Today, Hillary Clinton reaffirmed her support for tribal sovereignty and her respect for the government-to-government relationship. Recognizing that tribes are sovereign nations, as President, Hillary will seek to partner with tribes to improve health care, education, and housing for Native Americans living throughout this country.
Achieve Universal Pre-K for Native American Children: Studies show that providing four-year-olds with a high-quality early education leads to higher achievement and graduation rates and higher-earning careers. Nonetheless, less than 20 percent – only 800,000 out of four million – of four year olds and 120,000 three year olds are currently enrolled in state pre-K programs, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research. Hillary has proposed a national pre-K initiative that would extend access to high-quality pre-K programs to every four-year old in America. As part of her initiative, Hillary will allocate funds to tribally-sponsored pre-K programs. She will ensure that tribally-sponsored pre-K programs receive federal matching dollars just as state programs do. Her program is designed so that children from low-income families and children from limited English households can enroll in pre-K programs at no cost.
Increase Support for Tribal Colleges and Institutions Serving Native Americans: Since the late 1960s, the nation's tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) have played a critical role in promoting tribally-determined higher education. Currently, the 34 TCUs in the United States are providing culturally-relevant teaching, community outreach, and research services to tribal communities throughout the country. Hillary supports increased funding for tribal colleges. She voted for the recently signed College Cost Reduction and Access Act, which includes $10 million to help create a program for Native American Serving Institutions.
During the event, Senator Clinton discussed her agenda for a stronger America through job creation, quality education, health care for all and ending the war in Iraq. She outlined her plans to provide good jobs with good wages; encourage private sector investment and business growth in low-income areas; create more affordable housing in urban neighborhoods and ensure a strong federal-local partnership to fight crime.
"We know that the education system is not working when close to half of African American and Hispanic students will not receive high school diplomas with their class. Disparities in our education system mean poor and minority children receive an education that is often separate and rarely equal. And the consequences are devastating," Clinton said.
"I am setting a big goal for this country: to cut the dropout rate for students of color in half within a decade. I'll address the crisis of untapped potential. I believe we can do it. I reject the fatalism which says we cannot reform our education system. I reject the notion that children dropping out of school are a lost cause - because when I'm president, these children will be my cause."
When students don't complete high school, the consequences for their lives are devastating. On virtually all measures, high school dropouts struggle. They earn $35,000 less per year than college graduates - a wage gap that translates into $1 million over the course of a lifetime. They are three times more likely than college graduates to be unemployed and twice as likely as high school graduates to slip into poverty. According to the Dept of Labor, 90% of the fastest-growing, high-wage jobs require post-secondary education. And research shows that the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the 21st century workforce are the same skills and knowledge needed to succeed in post-secondary education.
Early College High Schools - As President, Hillary will support early college high schools, which are small schools designed to give students - especially those who are under-represented in higher education today - the opportunity to earn both a high school diploma and an associate's degree or up to two years of credit toward a bachelor's degree. Early college high school creates a smooth transition from high school to college by integrating students' high school and college experiences. When students complete early college high school, they not only have a diploma but also have enough college credits - or even an associate's degree – to go to a two- or four-year college or university, making higher education more accessible and affordable. The Early College Program Initiative, a consortium of 13 organizations funded by the Gates Foundation, was started in 2002 and has started or redesigned more than 160 schools in 24 states. Its first classes from its first three schools, over 95 percent of students graduated, 57 percent earned an associate's degree, and more than four out of five were accepted by a four-year college. North Carolina Gov. Mike Easley's "Learn and Earn High Schools," which gives students an opportunity to attend high school on community college and university campuses to earn both a high school diploma and two years of college transfer credit and/or an associate's degree in just five years, is another good example of such a program.
Support City and Community Plans to Track Dropouts and Support Disconnected Youth - Hillary believes that it will truly take a village to ensure that our children enter and successfully graduate from our school system. That's why she will call on mayors and other local officials to convene leaders from the education, labor, business, non-profit, religious, and workforce development sectors to develop comprehensive, locally-owned strategies to support children through to adulthood. The federal government will support this process by awarding $250 million per year in competitive grants to lower-income cities and communities. Communities will be encouraged to build off promising models like creating community youth centers - with case managers to track youth and provide support services - and expanding alternative education and Career Academy programs. Communities will also be encouraged to create an education continuum that will ensure that children at all stages of education (Pre-K through college) receive the intervention, support, and resources needed to succeed. This P-16 alignment will ensure that the curriculum in each state is aligned to the education standards and workforce expectation for the state, so that children can move from one grade to the next with the skills needed to succeed beyond high school.
Nobel Prize-winning economist James Heckman has said early intervention preschool programs for children from low-income families lead to higher achievement test scores, decreased grade retention, reduced time in special education, less crime and delinquency and increased high school graduation rates. Hillary thinks it's critical that we invest in early childhood education in order to address the dropout rate from the very start. That's why she has proposed to:
Expand Home Visitation - Innovative home visitation programs to help first-time mothers prepare for, and care for, their newborn children can make a real difference in the long-term education and life outcomes for at-risk children. Children who participated in these visitation programs had 56% fewer arrests and 81% fewer convictions than children who did not participate. Hillary will also expand Early Head Start.
That's why I've put forward a package of middle class tax cuts that will help restore the basic American bargain. If you work hard you can get ahead - with dignified work, a college education, affordable health care, child care, savings and wealth creation. We need to change our tax code to reward middle class families and by doing so, we can get money into the pockets of tens of millions of people who will spend it.
"I believe we need a new beginning in our economic policy - one that strengthens our middle class and ensures that prosperity is widely shared, and that is based on an ethic of shared responsibility. A new beginning that makes Wall Street shoulder its responsibility for this crisis, and that gives homeowners the breathing room they need. One that makes the most well-off pay their fair share and gives the middle class the help it needs for education, for health care, and for retirement."
Hillary Clinton, however, receives our support for her long standing commitment to implement the Dellums Commission agenda which addresses employment and anti-crime measures. Her experience, knowledge and commitment will serve us well. Her success as New York's senator where she demonstrated an ability to work both sides of the aisle bodes well as to how she could bring us together as a nation. The Post News Group and El Mundo agrees with assembly member Sandre Swanson, council members Ignacio De La Fuente and Jean Quan, Mayors Ron Dellums, Gavin Newsom, Antonio Villaraigosa, and Congresswoman Maxine Waters along with half of the members of the Congressional Black Caucus that Hillary Clinton has the mettle to fight for a green economy, increased educational support, withdrawal from Iraq, jobs for ex-offenders, foreclosure protection and the prosecution of predatory lenders, and increased support for urban areas.
Hillary's agenda for lifting up America's cities provides education and opportunity to youth in urban cities; encourages more economic opportunity; invests in urban areas; fights crime and violence; tackles poverty; and rebuilds crumbling physical infrastructure. Members of the African American community are praising Hillary Clinton for taking the lead in addressing the issues that are of great concern in urban communities.
"Hillary Clinton has a plan to provide better education and greater future for our youth. She has proposed a Youth Opportunity Agenda to bring new hope and possibilities to young people in our inner cities," said Gary Horton, Member of the Erie School Board. "This is why I am supporting Hillary Clinton, she has a proven record of standing up and fighting for the underserved youth in America and she has a solid plan to continue the fight when she gets to the White House."
Today, Hillary Clinton reaffirmed her support for tribal sovereignty and her respect for the government-to-government relationship between the tribes of South Dakota and the federal government. Hillary announced she will partner with the nine tribes in South Dakota to improve the economy, health care, education and housing throughout the state.
Increase Support for Tribal Colleges and Institutions Serving Native Americans: Since the late 1960s, the nation's tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) have played a critical role in promoting tribally-determined higher education. Currently, there are three TCUs in South Dakota providing culturally-relevant teaching, community outreach, and research services to tribal communities throughout the country. Hillary supports increased funding for tribal colleges. She voted for the recently signed College Cost Reduction and Access Act, which includes $10 million to help create a program for Native American Serving Institutions. Hillary wants to increase the number of Native American students graduating from public high schools from 66 percent to eighty percent in South Dakota helping to fund efforts being taken by the South Dakota Department of Education and the tribes designed to encourage more Native American youth to graduate from high school and pursue college degrees.
Today, Hillary Clinton reaffirmed her support for tribal sovereignty and her respect for the government to government relationship between the tribes of Montana and the federal government. Hillary announced she will partner with the Montana Tribes to expand economic opportunity and improve health care, education and housing on all seven Montana Reservations.
Increase Support for Tribal Colleges and Institutions Serving Native Americans: Since the late 1960s, tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) have played a critical role in promoting tribally-determined higher education.

Hillary supports increased funding for tribal colleges. She voted for the recently signed College Cost Reduction and Access Act, which includes $10 million to help create a program for Native American Serving Institutions. In addition, American Indians in Montana graduate from public schools at a rate of 56 percent. As president, Hillary will work to lower the drop out rate by recruiting and retaining excellent teachers and principles in low-income, hard to serve areas. And she will develop initiatives to identify at-risk youth early on and provide intensive interventions to get them back on track.
At the town hall in Pablo, Hillary will reaffirm her support for tribal sovereignty and her respect for the government to government relationship between the tribes of Montana and the federal government. Hillary said she will partner with the Montana Tribes to expand economic opportunity and improve health care, education and housing on all seven Montana Reservations.

We also have to be honest about the gaps that exist across our country, the inequality that stalks our streets. Because you cannot talk about smart policing and reforming the criminal justice system if you also don't talk about what's needed to provide economic opportunity, better educational chances for young people, more support to families so they can do the best jobs they are capable of doing to help support their own children.
Women—white women without high school education—are losing life expectancy. Black men and black women are seeing their life expectancy goes down in so many parts of our country.
"Service to our nation, and to our fellow citizens has long been a sacred American tradition – an experience that allows the concept of citizenship to grow full inside each of us. I'm very glad to see this concept, in the form of a Service Year spent in anything from education to conservation, brought prominently onto the stage of national debate. It is not a Republican, Democratic, or even an Independent initiative – the opportunity belongs to, and responsibility rests with, every American." – General Stanley McChrystal (Ret.), Chair of the Service Year Alliance
"This plan proves Hillary Clinton knows–as I do–that picking up a soup spoon to feed the less fortunate or a hammer to rebuild homes for those devastated by natural disasters is another important way to serve our nation, just as so many do in uniform. We must honor and support all kinds of American service, whether it is in the military or civilian capacity. I look forward to working with our next President to enact policies like my 21st Century American Service Act that expand service opportunities to all those willing to serve, promote a culture of service and help make higher education more affordable for countless young people." – Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, Iraq War Combat Veteran
"Hillary Clinton's plan for a National Service Reserve demonstrates her commitment to our next generation of leaders. Since the creation of AmeriCorps 20 years ago...I have seen how it has positively shaped communities. Hillary's plan to significantly expand AmeriCorps will give more young people the opportunity to serve and carry on the spirit of service." – Congresswoman Doris Matsui"It is no exaggeration to say that my life and career have been shaped by public service. While I have been recognized for this commitment, these experiences have given as much to me as I have to them. I attended college as a single mother and depended on welfare and TRIO to complete my education. After I graduated college, I wanted to do my part for the country that had given me so much. I became an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer, working to start a community credit union. The confidence and community I gained from VISTA led me to run for Wisconsin State Assembly, which led me to the State Senate, and eventually the United States House of Representatives. Service begets service, and I am proud to see Hillary Clinton's efforts to not only expand the opportunity for all Americans to serve, but work so that service is economically viable for all -- through living allowances and college scholarships. This proposal will not only benefit our country for generations, but underscores Hillary's belief that we are stronger together." – Congresswoman Gwen Moore"The National Service Reserve will not only enable young men and women to give back to their country, but also equip them with invaluable experiences and training that will enrich their lives. Whether in the military or in the communities, an entire generation can share the sacrifice needed to secure America's future. Indeed, I wholeheartedly endorse Hillary Clinton's plan to make us stronger--together." – Congressman Charles Rangel
"Secretary Clinton knows that young Americans are connected as never before to the world....and she would empower them to embrace national service by giving them new opportunities to work in Africa, Asia, and Latin America....to transform our world by combating diseases, improving girls' education, and fighting to save the earth's environment." – Aaron Williams, former Director of the Peace Corps
Now, every time I see him, which is not often enough, we always have a good conversation like we did before this event. He always gets you to think. Not only is he a world-class talent, but he is a passionate advocate for issues that are too often overlooked and ignored. He wants to -- and I'm going to do everything I can help him -- to deliver -- giving kids who are at risk access to educational and arts programs that they deserve to have just as much as any other child.

Well, I'm glad to hear that because it's time you had a governor who puts families first, not radical ideology.And I love seeing our educators stand up and applaud because you need a governor who actually cares about the education of the children of North Carolina.

But I don't think that every young person needs to go college. If you want to, I'm going to make it affordable for you, but if you also want some other way of making a good living, let's bring technical education back into high schools and connect them up with community colleges and business apprenticeships.

And we're going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers, no matter what zip code that child lives in. And I want to start with our youngest kids, with pre-kindergarten programs. And then I want to be a good partner with our teachers. We've got to have high expectation and get results in helping our children. And I want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them.

So I want to get the cost of education down. I want to get the interest rates on loans down. I want to give more forgiveness for debt for people who go into areas of shortage or need in our society, like math and science teachers or engineers. We have a lot of work that needs to be done in America and we aren't going to be successful if we make it so difficult for our young people to afford to go to college, stay in college and complete college.
But I guess I would underscore the importance of an education. Despite the difficulties and the challenges, I really wish you and your wife well. You are exactly the kind of young people that build communities and being close to your roots, you know how important it is to really keep your family going and make something of yourself.
And in order to attract the best people to government, I have joined on a bi-partisan basis with some of my colleagues in both the Senate and the House to propose a U.S. Public Service Academy â€“ an undergraduate school modeled after our military service academies that will cultivate a new generation of leaders dedicated to public service. The Academy would provide a four-year, subsidized college education in exchange for a five-year commitment to public service after graduation. It will help us produce a new generation of law enforcement officers, of civil servants of experts who will dedicate themselves to public service. We're seeing the retirement of so many people who have been doing the nuts-and-bolts work of the government for many years. And we don't see the pipeline filling with people who are willing to take these jobs. And yet I know that many young people are ready, willing and able to answer the call to serve. But they often graduate from college with so much debt that they can't imagine going into a public service career. So I hope that the Academy will open the doors much more widely for young people who want to serve their country.
And we won't just track government spending â€“ we'll also track results with a new America Results Initiative. With the technology we have today, we can get real-time data on just about anything â€“ from the purity of our water to the health of our ecosystems to the condition of our roads and bridges. We'll gather and analyze that data to see whether our government programs are effective. We'll then post it online so that our citizens can have the most up-to-date knowledge about everything from the quality of their air to the traffic on their streets. Information technology is revolutionizing every segment of society â€“ from business, to education, to entertainment â€“ and it's time that it revolutionized our government as well.
"Hillary Clinton has precisely the priorities our nation needs at this time -- a strong defense with a balanced hand to guide it, a will to strengthen education and health care, a fair tax system and a balanced budget - and equal treatment of every American under the law," said Elizabeth Birch, former executive director of the Human Rights Campaign. "The LGBT community has seen many hard political years. It is time for a renaissance for our nation and for our community."
That's why I have proposed providing family members the education and training they need to help their loved ones with TBI and giving them the option to become certified caretakers and paying them for providing this care for their own family members.
The original GI Bill of Rights was one of the VFW's signature accomplishments. It didn't just help a generation of veterans build their lives â€“ it helped a generation of Americans build a thriving middle class. So I take personal pride, tremendous personal pride in the fact that the VFW has endorsed my GI Bill of Rights. And I want to pay tribute to my House sponsor, young Congressman from Pennsylvania Patrick Murphy. I met Patrick Murphy when he was a Captain in the 82nd Airborne in Baghdad in 2003 when I was there on my first trip. That was still a time when we could get out of the green zone, we went to Sadr City, and we met with members of the 82nd, one of whom was this bright young Captain named Patrick Murphy. When he left the army he decided to continue his public service in another way. He ran for, and won, a seat in Congress. So when I was thinking about what kind of Bill of Rights, a GI Bill of Rights we needed for the twenty-first century, he was one of the first calls I made â€“ because he had lived it. And together, our bill provides educational opportunities â€“ from college, to trade and technical training, to certification and licensing programs. It expands opportunities for veterans to buy, build, repair and improve their homes. It creates a Veterans Micro-loaning Program to provide loans up to $100,000 at very low interest rates and without collateral, so that veterans can start their own small businesses. And I appreciate your support and we are going to get it done together.
Fourth, I want to transform the bureaucracy, we have a 20th century veterans' infrastructure and we need a 21st century system. I will do it by appointing a single, high-level experienced veteran, in the White House, reporting directly to me responsible for streamlining and coordinating all health care, educational and career programs for veterans. The reason I recommend this is because my last trip to Ft. Drum, I spoke to 50 of our 10th Mountain Division soldiers who had just came back from Afghanistan, all of whom had been wounded. The Department of Defense wasn't talking to the VA, the medical records at DOD didn't find them their way to the VA, and this made no sense to me at all. We need a single seamless system, and the way to get it done is to have someone in the White House reporting to the President, who will drive every single agency of this government to take care of every one of our veterans, the way they deserve to be taken care of.
That begins with ensuring that America does have the world's strongest and smartest military force. We've begun to change tactics in Iraq, and in some areas particularly in Al Anbar province it's working; we're just years too late changing our tactics. We can't ever let that happen again. We can't be fighting the last warâ€”we have to be preparing to fight the new war and this new war requires different tactics and strategies. We have to be prepared to maintain the best fighting force in the world. I proposed increasing the size of our army by 80,000 soldiers, balancing the legacy systems with newer programs to help us keep our technological edge, reevaluating the training and education programs that servicemembers need in the 21st century. And let's be sure that the American military does not fight terrorism alone. It is time that we demanded that our alliances, including NATO, are united with us in this fight and that their intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security systems are working together with ours. And let's not forget, that the War on Terror like the Cold War is fundamentally a battle over ideas and values.
"As the next President of the United States, Hillary will lead this nation in a direction of hope, change and prosperity," said Assemblymember Juan Arambula (D-Fresno). "Senator Clinton is the most qualified candidate in the race having tackled such critical issues as healthcare, education, job creation and a strong defense. Hillary Clinton is a positive change for our country and most especially for the Central Valley. I am proud and honored to offer my strong endorsement for Senator Hillary Clinton. "
"Senator Clinton has a great understanding and insight on critical issues facing our nation as well as the Central Valley. Senator Clinton's efforts on the environment, health care, education, and the economy are important to our quality of life here in the Central Valley and Fresno," said Fresno City Councilmember Blong Xiong.
Here at home, during my time in the Senate, I have cherished the opportunity to work with my women colleagues in both Houses and on both sides of the aisle. Now we may not see eye to eye on everything, but we get together and we trade those very important bits of advice like what kind of shoes to wear on marble floors when you're on your feet all day. And when it comes to the issues that we can agree on -- whether it's afterschool funding or healthcare and education for women here in America or for women in Afghanistan-- we are a force to be reckoned with.
Now, some might say that their work is finished in America since women no longer face legal obstacles to education or employment or the right to vote. But we know that even though legal barriers have fallen away -- economic and attitudinal ones still remain. And that so long as there are gaps between our aspirations and our reality, their work and ours is not finished. That more perfect union still awaits.
We need to recognize the challenges that so many people face today. You know, the economy is much more difficult. The average American family has lost a thousand dollars in income in the last six years but the costs of everything else have gone up- health care, education, energy and gas. It's much tougher for young families to really pull together the time they need for each other.
The Clinton plan also includes investments in providing the world's children with free, basic education, expanding opportunities for women, and eliminating the debt of the world's poorest countries.
Today, Hillary Clinton unveiled her strategy to fight disease and raise hope, opportunity and human dignity around the world. Her plan will reduce poverty, improve health outcomes, increase educational opportunity, expand economic development, and improve political and economic stability around the world.
As First Lady and Senator, Hillary Clinton has a long record of advocacy for increased development assistance. She has sought to increase funding for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs, raised awareness about the transformative power of microcredit programs, fought to expand education to all children, worked to improve access to essential health services, and has lead efforts to expand recognition of human rights as women's rights, and women's rights as human rights. As President, she will continue her leadership, with a focus on:
Beyond their personal appeal, the candidates have outlined ambitious policy proposals on health care, education and rural policy. Yet these proposals do little to help separate the field. Their plans are similar, reflecting a growing consensus in the party about how to approach priority issues.
In its endorsement editorial the Kansas City Star wrote that Hillary 'is a woman of obvious intelligence with a strong commitment to reform on health care, taxes, energy, immigration, education and global warming."
In our view, however, Sen. Clinton would be the top choice for the Democratic nomination. She is a woman of obvious intelligence with a strong commitment to reform on health care, taxes, energy, immigration, education and global warming.
3. It would authorize a grant program for research, educational, and media activities to memorialize the occupation of Guam.
We have a rare moment of opportunity to change America's course and restore our standing in the world. We must seize this moment by leading our friends and allies in building the world we want rather than simply defending against a world we fear. We must build a world that will be safer, more prosperous, and more just. I believe security and opportunity go hand-in-hand. When children have hope, a real belief that there is opportunity ahead for them, we help to dry up the swamp of fear and pessimism that breeds terrorism. That means supporting education, not just for boys but for girls too. It also means that real economic opportunity can't grow where there is no security. And that opportunity alone is not enough to overcome extremism.
So, I've been a champion for early childhood education for as long as I can remember, really starting when I was in law school and got interested in, as I was studying the law, why do some people follow the law and other people don't. What's—what's in their background? What makes them either a productive member of society or somebody on the outside who may be trying to tear down instead of build up?
But starting in 2001, there's been almost no progress. Only 55 percent of all of America's 3-and 4-year-olds are enrolled in preschool, and meanwhile, many of our economic competitors are racing ahead. They are making big investments in preschool and early education.
Republicans aren't just missing the boat on early-childhood education; they're trying to sink it. Their budget puts at risk on the most effective investments for our youngest children, Early Head Start.
When I was in high school, our class took a field trip to see a computer. I don't... [laughter] ... I don't think they do that anymore, but... [laughter] ... but it's really going to be—they're likely to retire in the 2080s. So how do you prepare them for this very complex world they're going to inherit? And many of them will hold jobs that haven't been invented yet. So it's really working on these skills, as you talked about—early childhood education. And we're thrilled that this discourse is now part of the presidential primary; that early childhood education is being talked about; and making sure ever child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.
And so here in New Hampshire, we've actually with the Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services and our governor's office applied for two federal grants, hoping to really show what we could do in early childhood education. So the Race to the Top—Early Learning Challenge Grant and the Preschool Development Grant, and we didn't get them. And one of the reasons, we're the only New England state that didn't get the Race to the Top Grant, because we've been divesting instead of investing.
So I—I—part of what I will be talking about in the campaign is how do we, you know, get our schools and doing so by respecting our teachers who are on the front lines of trying to... [applause] ... help kids. And, you know, trying to figure out what works for different kinds of kids. And I don't think a cookie-cutter approach works. I want every kid to do well in school. I want every kid to get the skills that that kid needs. I think we made an error when we eliminated in high school, in most high schools, technical education, what we used to call vocational education. [applause]
So we're going to take a hard look at all of that. But it's—you know, education is a local and state matter, but I think if we do a better job looking at all the research about what actually produces the best results, then we can come up with some incentive programs and some encouragement that will begin to try once again to get our education system to respond to the real needs that a whole variety of kids have.
Then in the Reagan Administration, I think it was 19—I want to remember here—'83 or so. There was a report that came out called "A Nation at Risk." And it compared our educational outcomes with comparable countries, mostly Europeans, some Asian, and basically said, you know, our kids are not keeping up, they're not performing. And that was really a big change.
But on education, we've put more federal dollars in. But to go back to the question about ADHD, we need to take a hard look about what's working and what's not working. I just want to give you a—and I'm going to roll out a whole education proposal, too. But I want to give you a quick understanding of what I mean.
You know, everybody believes, and I'm guilty of this, that we're an expert about education, because we went to school. [laughter]
So I think that we can do a better job in using the money we spend on education more effectively and trying to figure out where at state and local levels more expenditures would make a difference. And I'm very open to that because it breaks my heart that in a lot of poor districts right now, those poor schools have lost every extracurricular activity. They don't have sports teams anymore. They don't have bands. They don't have plays. They don't have a lot of the things that you remember from school and that for many kids gave them their first taste of success.
However, we seem to also do one more thing is compare ourselves to places like China. And our education is turning into worksheet-based education. Only we are drilling kids and art is disappearing, music is disappearing, even in [inaudible] rich schools where I live in Portsmouth. Art is once a week. Music is once a week. That's it.
So, can we try to compare ourselves also to places like Finland that do not start formal education until age seven? [applause]
They have early childhood education. They have paid leave. They have support for families. And yes, they don't start school until kids are seven, but those kids have not just been wandering around fending for themselves. They've been in organized settings, predominantly family-based, but not exclusively.
And if you look at the other countries—the best comparisons are to what are called the OECD countries, if you're interested in googling that and looking. They do a very thorough educational survey every few years and they lay out what's working and what's not working.
You know, we're just delighted again that this is part of a discourse in the presidential campaign, having early childhood education. And it really is in those earliest years—more than numeracy and literacy, it's those essential life skills, like you mentioned, perseverance, working in teams, ability to problem-solve, creativity that can make all the difference in preparing them for their future.
So far, we know that trying to do vet and understand the connections that a person or a family might have with somebody in the United States, you know, looking to see what organization, often a faith-based organization, will sponsor them and what they'll do to help them get education or a job, is by far the best way to sort out and to determine who should be included.
And the Republicans have blocked every effort to raise the minimum wage, better training, apprenticeship programs, make education more affordable. They have blocked every effort to try to make sure American workers were as prepared as possible to compete and win in the global economy.
And when they are not in school or at work, what are they doing? And—and plus, they're in underserved communities. And so my question to you is, what is your stance on supporting young people who really need opportunity, and more resources out there for better education, as well as better employment? And what will you do as president to help support those 5.6 million young people around the nation who it is affecting? Yeah. [applause]
What is it that can be done for John or Mary or whomever? So we need to support nonprofit groups, advocacy groups, organizing groups, faith communities to do this work. But secondly, we have to take a hard look. And one of the ideas that I have been thinking about is we take a hard look at communities where you have very persistent poverty, poor education outcomes, other kinds of indicators of problems.
And it will work, because what we are going to do is to focus on it being a compact between the federal government and state governments, and institutions. Because I do think that colleges and universities have to take a really hard look at what they are spending money on. [applause] So, that they make sure what they are spending on is related to helping prepare a student for life, for profession or career. I think states have dis-invested in higher education. A lot of the money that states use to put into colleges and universities has gone into everything from prisons to roads, you name it.
So, we got to figure out how the state does more of its fair share. I think that in order for it to be debt free, families above a certain income level will have to continue to fund college. I think that's only fair. And I want students to work 10 hours a week. Because I want students to know they are working for their education. And that it's something they really value. [applause]
And we've got a good G.I. bill now coming after 9/11—a new G.I. bill for the new generation of vets, but I want to make sure they don't get ripped off because sometimes that veteran education money is going to institutions that don't really serve them well. So we have some work to do to make sure that it is done right.
And it really is quite disturbing to me that we have had, as everybody knows in the last several years, because of the great recession, mostly—we've had really low interest rates. And yet, when I ask students what interest rate they are paying on their debt, lots of them are paying six, seven, eight, nine, 10 percent. Some of it private, some of it to the government. And I do not believe the federal government should be making a profit off of lending money to students to be able to go get a college education. [applause]
That means investing in our infrastructure, education and innovation – the fundamentals of a strong economy. We need to reduce income inequality, because our country can't lead effectively when so many are struggling to provide the basics for their families. And we need to break down the barriers that hold Americans back, including barriers of bigotry and discrimination.
Compare that with what Trump wants to do. His economic plans would add more than $30 trillion – that's trillion with a 'T' – $30 trillion to our national debt over the next 20 years. He has no ideas on education. No ideas on innovation. He has a lot of ideas about who to blame, but no clue about what to do.
So here's what I think we need to do, and it's not a luxury, it's a necessity – because I want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them. And I've heard so many stories. They've told me – people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses they're under. So let's finally, since every other advanced economy has already done this, let's have paid family leave so that when you're sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn, you can take care of your loved ones. And let's have earned sick days so that you don't lose your job because you're sick or you go to work because you're sick. And let's finally have affordable childcare, which in lots of states costs as much or more than in-state college tuition. I don't think any family should ever have to pay more than 10 percent of your income for childcare, and we're going to fix that so that becomes the norm. And then let's make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget.
So I'm excited about what we can do. I really am. And I'm going to leave it to the fact-checkers to go through all of – all of Donald Trump's claims. There were – there was a lot of work for fact-checkers last night. But here's a couple of things that caught my attention. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes. In fact, I think there's a strong probability he hasn't paid federal taxes a lot of years. And this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster; who goes around criticizing every institution, from health care to education, our vets. But he probably hasn't paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems.
And when I confronted him with the reasons why he won't release his tax returns – and I got to that point where I said, well, maybe he's paid zero – he said that makes him smart. Now, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us? I got to tell you, Bill and I have been blessed. We didn't come from millionaire families. My husband's father – his biological father died before he was born. His mother went to nursing school in order to support him. They struggled. They worked hard. And America gave him the chance to get a good education, pursue his dreams, end up being President. My dad, as I told you, worked hard.
And particularly, for all of the students here, affordable college education is at stake. And not only that, relief from student debt that you already have is at stake. So if you believe as we do that everyone should be able to afford to go to college and graduate and that everyone should be able to pay down and pay off their debt, then you've got to get out and vote in this election.

You know, that means that, number one, a lot of kids don't go who would be college material because they can't afford to start. A lot of other kids don't finish because they get there and they can't afford to complete their education. And thirdly, a lot of kids go and tough it out, often working, you know, jobs, sometimes more than one job, and they get out, and they have a lot of debt, which really hangs over them, making it very difficult for them to get started with their own lives and families.
But I believe this is a big problem because, if you actually look at the numbers, we haven't done that much to increase the percentage of our kids who actually graduate from college. And in a competitive global economy like the one we face today, we need to get our best educated kids out there competing. College, you know, you don't have to go to college to be a good person or to get a good job, but increasingly a lot of the jobs are really dependent upon additional education.
We have to give you planning for the education of your children. We have to make it easier for you and your husband to save. I have some proposals about how we can do that. With your parents, I assume they're still working, as you said in your question.
So I want to get the cost of education down. I want to get the interest rates on loans down. I want to give more forgiveness for debt for people who go into areas of shortage or need in our society, like math and science teachers or engineers. We have a lot of work that needs to be done in America and we aren't going to be successful if we make it so difficult for our young people to afford to go to college, stay in college and complete college.
But I guess I would underscore the importance of an education. Despite the difficulties and the challenges, I really wish you and your wife well. You are exactly the kind of young people that build communities and being close to your roots, you know how important it is to really keep your family going and make something of yourself.
Before that, Winterhof was the National Project Director for The White House Project, a non-partisan public education campaign working to see women at the highest levels of leadership in the country and served in the political operation of EMILY's List. Additionally, she served as a political appointee in the Clinton-Gore administration at the National Women's Business Council.
"Clinton wrapped up her two-day trip to New Hampshire in Keene Sunday afternoon, where she spoke to hundreds of people at a town-meeting style forum. ...She touched on what she called the 'heartbreaking dilemma' in Iraq confronting the country, her plan to bring universal health care coverage to the country, the need to reduce dependence on foreign oil, and plans to help families and students by investing in preschool education and making college more affordable. ... Westmoreland resident Jean M. Darcy said she was impressed that Clinton didn't 'waffle' on any of her answers to questions posed by residents. 'Hillary was not my top person before tonight,' Darcy said. 'But I think she's very intelligent. I'm confident she can do it.'"
"I said in 2004 that Hillary Clinton would be the best candidate," said Rep. Scott. "It's proving to be true. She is focused on the real issues such as education and better jobs. And she has the ability to lead our nation."
"Tom has made Iowa a leader in renewable energy and created thousands of jobs as one of America's great governors. We share a passion for protecting America's young people through expanded health care options, early childhood education initiatives and opening the doors to higher education to every American.
As a lead communicator for several public sector agencies, Hilarie Grey has been involved with critical Nevada issues ranging from growth, transportation and tourism to higher education. She led the Public Affairs units at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and Las Vegas-McCarran International Airport during transformational periods for both organizations, and most recently served as Communications Director for Dina Titus' gubernatorial bid.
"Congresswoman Schwartz is a leader on health care and education issues, and I'm honored to have her support," Senator Clinton said.
"Hillary shares our commitment to health care, education and ending the war in Iraq," added Christie Vilsack. "She has a sensible and realistic plan of action for America and the know-how to get things done in Washington."
"I am so deeply honored to have earned the support of one of America's finest Governors and First Ladies," said Senator Clinton. "The Vilsack administration truly lifted Iowa -- improving the quality of education in the state, expanding health care to thousands of children and becoming a national leader in the push for energy independence."
"We should put politics aside and unite behind a common goal: helping women prevent unintended pregnancies in the first place. Through access to education, contraception, and quality healthcare we can empower women to make safe, affordable, evidence-based family planning decisions," said Senator Clinton.
Over his 30 years as president, Yzaguirre helped build NCLR into the largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the country.

According to the National Committee on Pay Equity, working women stand to lose $250,000 over the course of a career because of unequal pay practices -- a difference in pay that cannot be explained by experience, education, or other qualifications. At the current rate of change, working women in Nevada will not achieve equal pay until 2020. Nationwide, women will not achieve equal pay until after 2050.

"Today, Equal Pay Day, we recognize this distressing gap and the impact it has on our families. Working women -- our neighbors -- do not get a discount on essentials for their families, costs like food, rent, healthcare or education," said Florida Arthenia Joyner. "Senator Clinton is taking a leadership role in addressing this issue in Congress, and I urge others to support her."
"Over her 35 years in public service, Hillary has fought for the issues I care most deeply about -- improving education for our children and making health care available to all Americans," NÃºÃ±ez said. "Given her breadth of experience, she is the only candidate who can hit the ground running on her first day in the Oval Office."
Washington, DC -- Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on President Bush to reconsider immigration proposals reportedly under consideration by the Bush Administration that would dramatically scale back the existing family visa system. The proposal reportedly would place caps and waiting periods on the parents of U.S. citizens applying for green cards, force all applicants who have been waiting in a family visa backlog to start again and pay a $500 fee, and create a point system that would deny visas to family members based on their education and skill levels. In a letter to President Bush, Senator Clinton emphasized that this immigration proposal would not only fail to help immigrant families, but would dramatically worsen the situation for families of hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens and lawful immigrants throughout the country.
"Although some AAPIs have reached the pinnacle of higher education, I am fully aware that others in the AAPI community continue to remain behind. For this reason, I have been a strong advocate for making college affordable and accessible. As Senator, I fought to increase the federal Pell Grant, which today covers only a third of tuition at an average public college and co-sponsored the DREAM Act, which makes it possible for hardworking young people to receive in-state tuition at state colleges. I also led the passage of legislation that will bring more qualified teachers into the classrooms and more outstanding principals to lead our schools.
Senator Larsen is currently serving her seventh term in the New Hampshire Senate. She has been a champion for working families throughout her career. Her legislative priorities have included include funding education, to include kindergarten; promoting job growth; establishing affordable health care; and safeguarding our environment.
"It is a great honor to receive this recognition," said Solis Doyle. "When I was growing up my parents had to take two or three jobs to be able to provide for our family. Their life story is what makes my work in public service, and particularly in this campaign, more significant. By helping elect Senator Clinton as President, we are helping hardworking families have access to health care, quality education and good paying jobs."
Senator Clinton introduced the 21st Century GI Bill of Rights Act of 2007 in the US Senate to make more education and financial benefits available to all service members who've served overseas in combat operation since September 11, 2001, as well as Active Duty personnel who've served a minimum of two years since then. National Guard and Reserve personnel who've served a minimum aggregate of two years on Active Duty since September 11, 2007 would also be eligible for benefits.
"The GI Bill has helped millions of soldiers transition successfully to civilian life and it has been one of the best investments we have made as a nation. Now it is time to update and modernize the GI Bill for the 21st century to meet the needs of today's soldiers, veterans and their families, from education to housing and microloans to start a small business. This is the right way to invest in the future of our service members and reward the service they have given to our country," said Senator Clinton.
Since September 11th, the Iowa National Guard has deployed more than 9,000 troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, which is more than 90% of the state's 9,700 strong force, and currently almost a thousand Guard service members are deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. As long as the soldiers met the two year requirement, under Senator Clinton's legislation, they would be eligible to receive the education and financial benefits she's proposed.
Senator Clinton's new GI Bill would extend the current program benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill to help more soldiers. Some of those benefits include funding eight semesters of undergraduate education for service members and expanding access to home and small business loans. More specifically, the bill would increase veterans housing opportunities by exempting them from paying loan fees and would expand their ability to purchase, build, repair or improve a home.
"Throughout her life Hillary has been a strong leader, working for issues that make a difference in every family's life, like education, health care and good paying jobs," said Huerta. "I believe she is the best qualified candidate and the one that's ready to put our country back on track."
Because the fact is, we cannot succeed in the global economy today unless our children universally are given the best start in life and then can take advantage of education and enter the world ready to be productive. Obviously if you look at the entire education system there's a lot of work we have to do. We have to make college more affordable and I've talked a lot about that. We have to make it possible for our teachers to have working conditions that give them the chance to be the best teachers we can be. There's a lot of things we need to do to reform and change No Child Left Behind, which is an unfunded mandate on our school. But we all know that preparing children to attend college or to start a career, to get the skills they need, starts way earlier than that. I'm going to be proposing throughout my campaign, additional investments in even younger children; those 0-3 because parents need high quality child care and much more in the way of parental support in education about how to do best job they can. Today, fewer than 20% of our four year olds in America are in pre-K programs that are funded by our various states. That's what I want to discuss because I think our educational system needs to be strengthened from start to finish, but we have to start where it all begins.
Today I'm announcing a proposal to establish universal pre kindergarten education; access to high quality pre-kindergarten for every single four year old in America. Our children are growing up in a world that is vastly more competitive and certainly a lot more technologically advanced than when most of us were those ages. I go into classrooms and it's pretty much familiar to me because it looks exactly like looked when I was in elementary school and that was a long time ago. And we have a lot of working care, a lot of single moms supporting kids, we have a lot of differences now than what we used to have. So how do we help prepare all of our children to be as successful as they possibly can? I've talked to lots of teachers about what happens the first day of kindergarten, the first day of first grade. Some children arrive already knowing how to write their name, they know how to interact with their peers, they thrive in a structured environment. Others don't; they are not even sure of how to fit in, or what they are supposed to do. They certainly don't know how to spell their names, in fact some of them don't even know their full name because they've been called by a nick name for so much of their lives. We can't let that continue if we expect our children to be successful.
Children who attend pre-kindergarten are less likely to enroll in special education; they are less likely to drop out of high school. They are more likely to go on and graduate from college. They are less likely to be unemployed, and they are less likely to go on welfare. As Professor Heckman said: early learning begets later learning, and early success begets later success. And if you add up all the benefits, it's is really astonishing. Another study done by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis show that investing in early childhood shows an annual rate of return of between 7 and 18%. In other words, you put in a dollar in early childhood, you are going to get at least seven dollars back. And imagine if you could buy a stock with that kind of return. That is why a lot of business groups including the Committee on Economic Development support universal pre-kindergarten. And it is not only for our family budget, it is good for everybody's budget. The cost of childcare, even if the childcare is frankly not that good, is pretty high these days, isn't it? And think about the savings that families could have if pre-kindergarten was accessible as public kindergarten is.
Years ago, my first job out of law school was to work for the Children's Defense Fund and it is one of the great jobs you could have because if you care about children's futures, if you believe it is important to do everything possible to help them, there is no better place. And the Head of the Children Defense Fund Marian Wright Edelman once said "if we don't stand for children, we don't stand for much." And I could not agree more. I saw these beautiful children here in this school today and every one of them has a divine spark inside, every one has the potential to be the kind of person that we all hope our children would grow up to be. Parents and family members have the first and primary responsibility, but then the rest of us have a role to play. That is why I wrote a book ten years ago called 'It Takes a Village', because you can be the best parent in the world and think you are doing the very best job, but your child is going to be affected by people you will know like teachers, and people you will never meet like police officers who try to keep the streets safe or people who check that the water you drink is safe. If we think about our responsibility for all our children, we will start making investments that will not only help our children but I believe really help us. So, today to stand up for our children, let's do what is done here in this school. I am looking at these young people here wearing their North Beach shirts and I am still proud that they are going to a school that really values them and appreciates how important it is that we make good investments. I am a big believer in public education and I am not giving up on public education. I think public education is absolutely essential [Applause].
Hillary Clinton proposed expanding pre-kindergarten classes to serve all of America's 4-year-olds in a policy address today at North Beach Elementary School in Miami Beach, Florida, providing them with a high-quality early education that studies show leads to higher achievement and graduation rates and higher-earning careers. More than 80 percent of 4-year-olds are currently not enrolled in state pre-kindergarten programs.
"Every child - not just children whose parents can afford it - should have the same chance to succeed and to fulfill his or her God-given potential," Clinton said. "As President, I will establish universal pre-kindergarten education through a federal-state partnership, based on state flexibility, that ensures every four-year-old child in America has access to a high-quality pre-kindergarten program."
"Senator Clinton's pre-K proposal shows she understands that the wisest investment we can make for the future of our country is the investment we make in our children's education," New Hampshire House Majority Leader Mary Jane Wallner, who has been a prominent early childcare advocate in New Hampshire for decades and Director of the Merrimack Valley Day Care in Concord, NH. "Brain research has shown that developmentally appropriate early education programs help young children obtain the skills they will need to be successful in school."
"Senator Clinton's plan is a pro-active, detailed approach to Early Childhood Education and clearly shows Hillary's commitment to education," said Marilyn St. George, a former Reading Recovery teacher and literacy specialist who teaches third grade at Wilkins Elementary School in Amherst, NH. "This initiative reaffirms for me the respect that Senator Clinton has shown in the past for educators. Requiring highly qualified teachers to teach four-year-olds is essential as young children are at a crucial developmental stage and need and deserve the very best we have to offer."
"Every child - not just children whose parents can afford it - should have the same chance to succeed and to fulfill his or her God-given potential," Clinton said. "As President, I will establish universal pre-kindergarten education through a federal-state partnership, based on state flexibility that ensures every four-year-old child in America has access to a high-quality pre-kindergarten program."
The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) in a statement yesterday welcomed Clinton's pre-K Plan. "Sen. Hillary Clinton knows what we at the AFT know: Children's success in school starts long before they enter a kindergarten classroom. Our country has long needed—and the AFT has long called for—a universal pre-kindergarten program. We commend Sen. Clinton for choosing early childhood education as the focus of the first major education initiative of her presidential campaign."
The AFT represents 1.4 million pre-K through 12th-grade teachers; paraprofessionals and other school-related personnel; higher education faculty and professional staff; nurses and healthcare workers; and federal, state and local government employees.
"It is so important that children entering First Grade are fully ready to learn and it is essential it is for preschool to be available to all children," said St. George. "A quality preschool program provides the child with their very first educational experience and can be the catalyst that transforms a child to 'learner' early-on. If this stage of learning is given the importance that is necessary, the child will become a lifelong learner who is also enthusiastic and confident."
As a Senator, Hillary has championed legislation that will help create good jobs, develop new sources of capital, and invest in education, healthcare, broadband, agriculture, biofuels and other renewable energy sources in order to grow the economies of rural America. Senator Clinton has been a tireless advocate of restoring the promise of rural and small town America. She has worked to expand access to broadband and spur innovative strategies for rural economic development. In a major speech last year, Senator Clinton addressed the many challenges facing rural communities and called for new strategies to preserve the quality of life and keep good jobs in rural and small-town communities.
Well, thank you very, very, much. I am delighted to be back at GW and I want to thank President Trachtenberg for his kind introduction, but he and his wife Francine have been leading advocates on behalf of higher education and so many other issues for as long as I've known them, and that goes back many years. And as Joel said, we shared the experience of our children in high school, and that was indeed an experience we both survived, so we're grateful to tell the tale.
As I travel around America, I have talked with people from all walks of life about the challenges that our country is facing: from ending the war in Iraq to ending our dependence on foreign oil -- from improving our education system to reducing our deficit. And no matter where I go or with whom I talk -- whether it's small business owners or CEOs, doctors or nurses or patients -- I hear growing concern about the crisis in our health care system: exploding costs, declining coverage and shortcoming in care and prevention.
Earlier this month, Senator Clinton sponsored 21st Century GI Bill of Rights Act of 2007 to make more education and financial benefits available to all service members who've served overseas in combat operation since September 11, 2001, as well as Active Duty personnel who've served a minimum of two years since then. National Guard and Reserve personnel who've served a minimum of aggregate of two years on Active Duty since September 11, 2007 would also be eligible for benefits. In New Hampshire, there are 2,700 National Guard and Air and Army National Guard and more than 1,500 of whom have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan in the last three years.
Senator Clinton's new GI Bill would extend the current program benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill to help more soldiers. Some of those benefits include funding eight semesters of undergraduate education for service members and expanding access to home and small business loans. More specifically, the bill would increase veterans housing opportunities by exempting them from paying loan fees and would expand their ability to purchase, build, repair or improve a home. The bill would also establish a Veterans Microloan Program to provide veterans microloans for entrepreneurial ventures up to $100,000 with interest rates capped at 2.5 percent and without requiring collateral.
Clinton has been a longtime advocate for veterans, calling attention to Gulf War Syndrome as First Lady, and leading efforts in Congress to provide life-saving armor for our troops and their vehicles in Iraq. She recently proposed a new GI Bill of Rights, which would expand opportunities for veterans to pursue education and home ownership and provide low-interest loans to start their own businesses. Her bill would also cut red tape for military personnel to receive the benefits and the healthcare they need, and crack down on predatory lenders who target military families.

Her bill would also cut red tape for military personnel to receive the benefits and the healthcare they need, and crack down on predatory lenders who target military families.
Fifth, let's recommit ourselves to the idea that every young person in America who wants to should have the opportunity to attend college, and that a 21st-century education starts early in life and continues well into adulthood.
You know, a lot of people around the world are writing America off. They do believe our best days are behind us. I could not disagree more. I believe America can rebound from these last six years. I believe we can restore fairness and ensure that all share in our prosperity. I believe we can reduce the deficit and restore fiscal responsibility and give people the education and opportunities they need to fulfill their God-given potentials.
Hillary Clinton laid out her progressive vision for strengthening the middle class in the face of rising income inequality and globalization today. In a speech at the Manchester School of Technology in New Hampshire, she called for a return to shared prosperity and tax fairness, while expanding access to quality education and healthcare for all Americans.
"Hillary has always been an advocate for those without a voice in society," said Brown. "She has championed equal access to education, health care and home ownership - and fought discrimination in all its forms. I know that as President, she will be a leader who gives voice to all of our hopes for a better America."
Villaraigosa and Clinton announced the endorsement after a tour of the preschool at UCLA's Krieger Center, where Clinton discussed her plan to provide pre-K access to all American children, including the more than 90% of California 4-year-olds who are not enrolled in a state pre-K program. Both Mayor Villaraigosa and Senator Clinton believe that a quality education begins with access to preschool and ensuring that students are educated by highly-trained teachers. They share the belief that every four-year old -- not just those whose parents can afford it -- should have the same opportunity to fulfill their full potential.
Villaraigosa was elected Mayor in 2005, and immediately set about tackling the toughest challenges facing Los Angeles. Since assuming office, he has championed an education reform plan that puts students first, ensures greater accountability in the schools, and gives principals, teachers, and parents more control over their campuses. He has accelerated the city's use of renewable energy to 35% by 2020, secured funding for 1,000 new police officers, and deployed a comprehensive strategy to combat gang violence. Villaraigosa has also focused on quality of life issues, increasing funding for affordable housing, implementing common sense strategies to reduce traffic gridlock and funding basic city services at historic highs.
Miller served as Governor of the State of Nevada from 1989 to 1999, and is distinguished as the longest serving governor in state history. He served as Chair of both the National Governors Association (1996-7) and the Western Governors Association (1993-4). He also served as Co-Chair of ACHIEVE, NGA's public/private partnership to improve American education. He is a founding member and current Chair of the Past Governors Association.
Miller, who has held several elected offices including Lieutenant Governor and Clark County District Attorney, is known for his leadership and advocacy for education, combating crime and protecting natural resources. During his tenure as governor, he was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.
"Bob is one of the most respected leaders in the country, due to his achievements as Governor of one of the fastest-growing states in the nation, his work in promoting education at all levels and strengthening public safety in our communities, and his leadership among state executives on a national level," said Clinton. I am delighted that he will help to lead our efforts nationally."
Unfortunately, while other nations have marched ahead, we've been marching sideways. Over the past twelve years, while American investment in research and development has remained relatively static, China has doubled the share of its national wealth invested in R&amp;D. The European Union has set a goal of increasing R&amp;D investments by member states to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2010, nearly matching us. The education pipeline, the source of future innovators, reveals the same trend. Between 1970 and 2000, as many as of you know too well, America's global share of PhDs in science and engineering declined from 40 percent to 20 percent. That rate is expected to drop to 15 percent in the next 3 years. Too few of our college students are studying the STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering, and math.
While investing in ideas and research, we should also invest in skills and education. This has become almost a clichÃ©, hasn't it? And I have had countless meetings with people from the Silicon Valley and in Silicon Valley bemoaning the shortage in the skills that are needed.
Now, light bulb moments require electricity. And education is the ultimate innovation prerequisite. Unfortunately, here again we are ceding ground to other nations. 50% of the undergraduates in China are earning degrees in science and engineering; in America the rate is 15%.
These are modeled on two successful programs in New York. I also included a study to be conducted by the National Academy of Sciences to investigate promising practices in math and science education.
We obviously need to do a better job of reproducing educational excellence and we need to have national standards in math and science education. There's not a difference in algebra across state lines and we act as though there is, and it's time to say enough. We need national standards, at least, in math and science.
One thing that I would offer for your consideration is whether it is possible to create some kind of continuing education or curriculum that could be available because what I find as I travel around the country are engineers who come up to me and say, "I've been an engineer at this country for 12 years or 18 years, and now I'm being asked to train my successor because my job is being outsourced. What am I supposed to do?" Well, if that engineer's talent and skills truly are not marketable in the current from, then what can we do to try to make them marketable? How can we create that opportunity?
"I am absolutely thrilled to endorse Hillary Clinton today, and can't wait to see her take office as our next president," said Giunchigliani. "Hillary is a visionary with an unmatched record of advocacy on behalf of those without a voice in society. As president she will fight for better education, more accessible health care and ethical, responsible government. Those are priorities with the power to set our nation on the right track. I'm honored to play a strategic role in the campaign and to help Hillary make history -- here in Nevada and all the way to the White House."
"Chris Giunchigliani is a true dynamo, with tremendous knowledge of Nevada and one of the most recognized grassroots networks in the West," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "Her work as a special education teacher, community advocate and elected official gives her a unique understanding of the important role government can play in assisting the disadvantaged. Her experience and endless enthusiasm will be tremendous assets to our efforts."
"As a proven expert and innovative advocate on both domestic and international issues, Hillary Clinton has the best credentials to lead our country, hands-down," said Gomez. "Throughout her career she has been a champion for middle-class, working Americans, and as President she will bring forward policies carrying the best opportunities for those who have been invisible in society. Her lifelong commitment to removing economic disparities and increasing access to education will benefit Hispanics in Nevada, and throughout the nation. My family and I are honored, excited and ready to work hard to support Hillary Clinton's efforts in our home state."
Owner and general manager of an award-winning industrial janitorial business and known as a leading advocate for minority business development and education, Robert Gomez is the 2007 Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Las Vegas Latin Chamber of Commerce. He has served on the Chamber's board for the past five years, during which time he has spearheaded development of innovative programs designed to assist Latin businesses in such areas as bank loans, minority business certification, marketing and capacity building.
Mayor Menino, currently serving his fourth term as the Mayor of Boston, is credited with working to provide every child with a quality education, create affordable housing, lower the crime rate, revitalize Boston's neighborhoods, and promote a healthy lifestyle for all city residents. As President of the United States Conference of Mayors from 2002-2003, he championed homeland security and housing availability.
Lansing civic leader and Michigan State Trustee Joel Ferguson said, "Hillary Clinton has devoted her life to expanding opportunity for all Americans. She is a leader Michigan can trust to address our priorities -- strengthening our economy, creating and protecting jobs, improving education and demanding universal healthcare. Hillary has been tackling the tough issues facing our country for three decades. No one would be a better partner for Michigan and its workers, and no one is better prepared to be President."
Dina Titus has dedicated her entire professional life to education and public service. She has taught American and Nevada government at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), for the past 30 years. She has represented Senate District 7 in the Nevada Legislature since 1998, serving as the Democratic Minority Leader since 1992. She currently serves as Democratic National Committeewoman for the State of Nevada.
Meek has also led efforts to improve Florida's education system, chairing an initiative to reduce class sizes in the state's overcrowded public schools. He spearheaded a petition drive to collect more than 500,000 signatures, and helped defeat two state Supreme Court challenges to get the measure approved.
Hillary maintains a well of goodwill from her work as an advocate for children and the poor in Arkansas and her 12 years as First Lady. She ran a legal aid clinic when she first arrived in the state, and took on child advocacy cases pro bono. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, chaired the Arkansas Rural Health Advisory Committee, and led the Arkansas Education Standards Committee to improve public education in the state. Hillary also introduced an innovative preschool program, Home Instruction Programs for Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY), in Arkansas, and served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital, helping to expand and improve its services.
As Speaker, Sires was instrumental in raising the state minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.15 and creating college tuition scholarships for thousands of students. He also led the fight to increase funding for public education by $760 million and establish new standards for homeland security measures and emergency preparedness.
"I support Hillary Clinton because she is the candidate that will help boost the prospects of the middle class," said Huntington Park Mayor Elba Guerrero. "Her policies will help more students get a better education beginning with pre-K on to college, and she will help more families achieve the American dream. I urge others to join me in voting for Hillary Clinton."
Senator Clinton has long been a champion of higher education and supporting college students. Two of the provisions from the Student Borrower Bill of Rights were enacted into law during the 109th Congress through the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense 2006. Two of the provisions from the previously introduced Nontraditional Student Success Act were also enacted into law through the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.
"Hillary Clinton is a leader. Her life embodies the experiences, courage and tenacity needed in Washington to stand up for us, to put us first and give us a true voice in our government," Matthews, a businessman and retired elementary school principal, said. "Hillary Clinton understands policy. She knows health care. She knows education. She knows how to support our families and communities. Hillary Clinton knows how to make policy that puts us first in South Carolina."
Instability and extremism fester in places where infrastructure, education, and opportunity are also lacking. I've introduced the Education for All Act to provide $10 billion over five years toward the goal of basic education for every boy and girl around the world. From Pakistan to Sudan, parents want their children to have an education, but too often governments fail in delivering that basic service or find themselves without the resources to do so even if they are willing. Education is a tool to combat HIV/AIDS, empower women, and certainly for economic development. And I believe all of that plays to our strengths.
You know, despite the professed attempts at military transformation, much more needs to be done. We do need to increase the size of the Army to address the myriad threats that we still face, even after we begin withdrawing from Iraq. We need to reform the Pentagon's acquisition system to rein in the costs of weapons systems and spending on outside contractors. And we need to find the right mix between legacy systems that our service members are currently using and newer programs that will allow us to keep our technological edge.Our experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan mean that we must not just learn but incorporate the lessons of asymmetric warfare and train and equip our forces accordingly.Finally, we need to re-evaluate the entire training and education that service members need in the 21st century.
"Hillary Clinton has precisely the priorities our nation needs at this time -- a strong defense with a balanced hand to guide it, a will to strengthen education and health care, a fair tax system and a balanced budget - and equal treatment of every American under the law," said Elizabeth Birch, former executive director of the Human Rights Campaign. "The LGBT community has seen many hard political years. It is time for a renaissance for our nation and for our community."
"Once again, the Roberts Court has shown its willingness to erode core constitutional guarantees. It is a set back for all of us who are on the long march toward racial equality and the building of a stronger more unified America. As President, I will fight to restore Brown's promise and create an education system where all children have an equal chance to learn and excel together."
"Hillary Clinton has devoted her life to helping others," Dinkins said. "From healthcare to education to caring for our veterans, she has been a champion for the millions of Americans who have been invisible to this administration. Her depth of experience and her strength of character make her uniquely suited to be President."
"I am honored to be joined by so many leaders that have dedicated their lives to advocating for better education for our children, access to health care, civil and voting rights and advancing economic opportunities not only for Latinos, but for all Americans," Clinton said. "With their support, we will continue taking our message of change across the country."

Elected in 1999, Mayor Street launched an ambitious effort called the Neighborhood Transformation Initiative to revitalize local communities by eliminating blight and decayed properties, developing affordable and market-rate housing, and cleaning and securing city streets. Mayor Street also focused on improving the lives of the city's children, forming the Philadelphia Children's Commission, developing after-school programming, supporting education reforms and creating programs to reduce truancy.
Prior to his election as mayor, Street served 20 years on the Philadelphia City Council and was chosen unanimously by its members to serve as president in 1992 and 1996. As Council President, Mayor Street was known for his expertise on a range of issues including city budgeting and fiscal matters, housing, education and crime. Working with then-Mayor Edward G. Rendell, Mayor Street helped craft and implement a financial plan that turned a $250 million deficit into the largest surplus in city history.
"I am honored to be joined by so many leaders that have dedicated their lives to advocating for better education for our children, access to health care, civil and voting rights and advancing economic opportunities not only for Latinos, but for all Americans," Clinton said. "With their support, we will continue taking our message of change across the country."
"It is with great pleasure that I endorse Senator Clinton," said Keating. "Hillary has been a champion for rural communities like the ones in Nye County. She has brought forward legislation to create good jobs and invest in education, health care and renewable energy sources to grow the economies of rural America. She strives to preserve the quality of life for all Americans. Her book "It Takes a Village" proves her lifelong commitment to our nation's next great leaders, our children. Americans are ready for a change - and in an outstanding field of Democratic candidates, I believe Hillary has the greatest ability to lead, to work with others, and to turn this great nation around from her first day in office."
Dennis Keating has served on the Nye County School District Board of Trustees since 2003, and was elected president in 2007. He served as statewide Legislative Chair representing all seventeen Nevada counties in 2005 and 2007, and this year also served as the Federal Relations Network education representative in Washington, D.C. A Transportation Supervisor for the Clark County Department of Aviation, Keating is also an active volunteer for Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Southern Nevada, United Way Pioneer Territory and U.S. VETS, a public private partnership for homeless veterans. A professional musician, Keating also serves as a VFW bugler.
Rep. Clarke (Brooklyn, NY 11th CD) is in her first term in Congress after serving five years on the New York City Council representing Brooklyn. She was also the Chair of the Contracts Committee during her tenure in the Council. In Congress, Rep. Clarke serves on the Homeland Security, Education and Labor, and Small Business House Committees. Rep. Clark is dedicated to providing responsible governance for immigration reform, education, employment and economic development.
Hillary Clinton today received the endorsement of a group of Nevada officials known for their leadership in education -- longtime Clark County School District official and current State Senator Joyce Woodhouse, Nevada System of Higher Education Regents Cedric Crear and Thalia Dondero, and Nevada State Education Association (NSEA) Deputy Executive Director Debbie Cahill.
"I first saw Hillary Clinton speak in Las Vegas years ago and remember being just captivated by her knowledge and passion talking about health care, and the need to take responsibility for our children. These are the issues closest to my own heart," said Woodhouse. "I went to Carson City for the chance to improve education and health care, to ensure a better future for children and seniors in our state. I know that Hillary Clinton is ready to bring about real change. She will be a wonderful president and I am proud to be on her team."
"As a longtime public official I am thrilled that the early caucus has engaged Nevadans in the issues at stake during this presidential election cycle," said Dondero. "I am proud to support Senator Clinton, who has distinguished herself as a great champion for improving education at all levels, and making health care accessible and affordable for all who are in need."
"America is ready for a change from the failed educational policies of the Bush administration, and I know that Hillary Clinton is ready to lead that change." said Cahill. "She understands that we need to attract and retain experienced teachers and pay them as professionals, and that we must expand access to quality education beginning with the earliest grades. She will also reform the so-called 'No Child Left Behind' act, which has failed our children. I'm excited to work on behalf of Senator Clinton in Nevada, knowing that she will make our education system a true priority."
Elected to the Nevada State Senate in 2006, Joyce Woodhouse has a distinguished career as both an educator and advocate. She has been an elementary school principal and teacher, and served as an education lobbyist for four sessions of the Nevada State Legislature. As Director of the School-Community Partnership Program for the Clark County School District, she served as a liaison with the business community, with the mission of unifying school and community resources to enhance the educational experiences of students. Her public service has extended to many community organizations and boards, including Silver State Schools Credit Union, Kids Voting USA/Greater Las Vegas and The JASON Project and Immersion Presents Science Consortium. She has served as both chairman and member of the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees Retirement System of Nevada, and was recognized as an "Unsung Hero" by the Nevada Public Education Foundation.
"These four great leaders -- Joyce, Cedric, Thalia and Debbie -- bring diverse community experiences and networks to our campaign," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "They share Senator Clinton's commitment to making our education system strong and accessible at all levels, so that every American can fulfill his or her potential. We are extremely gratified for their support."
"She's a big supporter of the COPS program that put more police on our streets. She's a proponent of the CHIPS program to help cover uninsured children, and she's committed to making sure every South Carolina child and every American child has the opportunity for a world-class education. She's ready to work on these things from her first day in office and that's why we need her as President," Willis said.
"Hillary Clinton is a smart, tough and tested leader who believes, as I do, that education is the foundation of a strong society," said Rogers. "Fixing our broken education system will help restore our nation to its place of prominence and leadership in the global marketplace. I know that as president, Senator Clinton will work to broaden access to education and empower innovation. Of all the great candidates in the field this year, she is the most prepared to get America back on track. She has my enthusiastic endorsement, and I'm proud to be a part of her leadership team in Nevada."
As Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education, Rogers serves as chief executive officer for the state's system of eight institutions of higher learning. An active supporter of higher education, he has served on numerous boards and executive committees for colleges and universities across the country.
Rogers and his wife, Beverly, have contributed or pledged more than $275 million to various colleges and universities. Their gift of $115 million to the University of Arizona College of Law is to date the largest gift to any American law school. In November 1998, the Arizona Board of Regents renamed the University of Arizona college of Law The James E. Rogers College of Law. Most recently, Rogers was listed as one of the top twelve philanthropists in the Nation by Time Magazine, recognizing his work on behalf of higher education. Beverly Rogers, who recently completed her MA in English Literature and is pursuing her Ph.D. in Literature at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, has made substantial contributions on her own to universities including the English Departments at the University of Arizona and UNLV.
"I can't think of a more passionate advocate for education in the state of Nevada – and even in the nation - than Jim Rogers," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "As a businessman and community leader, Jim has worked to make our state stronger, and encouraged others to do the same. His endorsement makes a strong statement about Hillary Clinton's experience, leadership and commitment to the issues that matter most."
"I am demonstrating my support for Senator Clinton's presidential bid by serving on the National Mayors Council," said Mayor Johnson, who will serve as one of 11 council co-chairs. "I am a firm believer that Senator Clinton's experience, intelligence and compassion will serve as galvanizing forces to change course and lead our country in the right direction. As president, Senator Clinton will fight to ensure that Americans living in rural communities like Lovelock, have equal access to affordable healthcare, good education and other programs to make the United States and its citizens the strongest they can be."
"Across America there is a growing hunger for change," said Palmer, Mayor of Trenton, New Jersey. "At a critical time in our history, Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to lead from her first day in office. She has shown a deep understanding of the issues facing our communities, from improving education to creating new jobs to helping keep our neighborhoods safe, Hillary will be a partner we can count on in the White House."
Thousands of students from rural Nevada communities may soon have access to new programs designed to improve educational achievement, build leadership and offer insight into higher education and career opportunities, thanks to legislation introduced by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) and Arlen Specter (R-PA).
Last week, Clinton and Specter introduced the Rural Students College, Career, and Community Readiness Act of 2007. The legislation will establish partnerships between non-profit entities and rural school districts to improve the educational and career outcomes of rural, low-income students.
"The facts are daunting and present a major hurdle in improving education for students in rural communities. If our country is to successfully compete in the global economy we must ensure all students have access to an excellent education," Senator Clinton said.
Roughly one in four public schools is located in rural America. Studies have shown students attending these rural schools generally have lower educational aspirations and lower post-secondary achievement than their urban and suburban peers.
"Nevada has one of the fastest growing school systems in the country, however keeping pace with this expansion and providing all Nevada students with equal opportunities to succeed at the next level is challenging," said Dennis Keating, President of the Nye County School District Board of Trustees. "Senator Clinton's bold rural education initiative is an important piece of legislation that will help students of Nevada reach their full potential regardless of economic and geographic differences. I look forward to working with school districts, community leaders and non-profit organizations to implement the Rural Students College, Career, and Community Readiness Act of 2007."
Senator Clinton has been a champion for improving educational opportunities for rural students. She has introduced legislation to improve access to high-quality after-school tutoring for students in rural schools and to expand broadband access in rural areas, enabling more opportunities for distance learning.
"Senator Clinton's unmatched experience makes her the most qualified candidate to be our next President," said Vermont State Senator Hinda Miller. "People throughout the county, including those right here in Vermont, will benefit from the Senator's commitment to government reform, repairing our healthcare system, and providing affordable quality education.
"As President, she will appoint federal judges that will uphold the equal access laws in our country and ensure that every American has fair access to jobs, education, housing, and quality health care," Aiken City Councilperson and South Carolina Co-Chair of the Clinton campaign Lessie Price said. "Her administration will make discrimination a thing of the past, and open new doors to opportunity. It's time that America stop sliding backward, and move forward towards a society where not a single man, woman or child is held back or discriminated against because of their race, color or religion."
We also know that right now we could make changes in a lot of our buildings. And I actually teamed up much to everyone's surprise with probably the Congress' leading skeptic on global warming, Jim Inhoffe, the senator from Oklahoma who chaired the environment committee for most of my time in the Senate when I served on the committee. But Senator Inhoffe and I just got passed in the energy bill a provision to tell the federal government to look at how they could power their buildings differently right now. Don't wait. Including looking a geothermal, which in many parts of the country has tremendous possibility. We've done some geothermal work in New York. There's a town Auburn, New York where geothermal is heating and cooling the city hall where their using geothermal in a few other of the facilities. We just want a lot of other different ideas to happen. Solar energy remains an under utilized source of power, particulary electricity. Other countries have moved much more quickly. Germany is getting a lot of their power from solar now. And they're not a tropical climate and yet they have a combination of government incentives and public education programs going on that had moved a lot of people towards photovoltaic cells on their roofs in their construction. We've got to figure out how to incentivize that. One of the problems we face is the resistance to using the tax structure to change behavior because by using the tax structure, you will move people away from fossil fuels, that's where the oil companies and the gas and the coal companies come back in. They don't want us to give a lot of tax incentives. We tried to do that in the energy bill, we got 57 bipartisan votes but we needed 60 under the rules of the senate, so we are going to go back and try again. But the reason we didn't is because if we put more tax money on more solar, more wind, more geothermal it would mean that the oil companies, coal companies, gas companies would obviously start losing market share. So we still have real political challenges here that we are going to try and address. Let me just finish by talking about 2 things that are really near and dear to me that I have worked on since 20012. I'm not new to these issues I care deeply about them and have been involved in them for a long time. The first was something that I understand a lot of your schools are doing and I couldn't find the real brochure so I brought this copy, but back in 2001 I sent out this brochure to every school district in New York and it says 'smart schools save energy.' Because I did a survey about how much money school districts, which are always hard pressed for money in New York and I know here in New Hampshire that most school spend more money on energy than they do on books or computer's. And by simple changes that might cost some front-end money, they would begin to save 25 to 30 percent through better building design, use of renewable energy technology and sensible changes in operation and maintenance. And that was back in 2001 because as a traveled around New York I realized there are a lot of old school buildings, they needed to be weatherized, they needed to be upgraded, with some initial investment, they could save a lot of money of the next 20 to 20 years. The other thing I've done over the last several years is work very hard with Rochester, New York, which, as you just heard is going to be the place of the plant that will use the Dartmouth technology. And I brought in the US green building council and other folks that were interested. And we created a green print for Rochester. We spent a couple of years doing it: bringing everyone to the table, private sector, public sector, outside experts and this report is the result. Looking at how one city could move on all levels at one time. What could be done to make buildings more efficient, to have an outreach campaign to citizens so we would turn off lights when we left the room. We would unplug appliances that would such up energy when they were not working. That we would use compact florescent bulbs that we would try to be more conscious about how we drove, maybe be more efficient in our driving patterns and so much else that we could do on a local personal level as well as a local level through municipal planning. And I am really convinced that we have to move on all these levels at one time. Yes, we cannot be successful if we don't have a president who believes in this mission. I believe in this mission. And I will start be reigniting our international involvement. We cannot sit here, in the united sates and expect to deal with global warming if we do not cooperate with other countries. Getting back into process, you know when president bush took us out of Kyoto, I regretted that but he had an opportunity to start his own process, he didn't want to do Kyoto, do something else. Reach out to India and China they have to be part of this. One of the flaws of the Kyoto process was I don't think people anticipated, even in the early 90s how quickly china and India would grow. China is now growing at 12 percent a year. They are the second highest user of energy but they are now the highest emitter of green house gases in the world. India is not far behind. We have got to get a new international process. The dispute about the science is thankfully over the IPCC finally put that rest last year. So, get that off the table. What is it that we are going to do? What kind of presidential leadership do we have internationally? And then building a coalition here at home to pass the energy legislation to the global warming legislation and lets not forget the environmental health piece of this. And that's the last thing I'm going to say. Every year I have been a senator I have introduced legislation to create an environmental health tracking system. There are really three triggers: genetics, behavior and environment and their interaction.; what we know is that the environment plays a big roll. You know, I represent places in New York City where w25, to 30 percent of the children have serious asthma. It just so happens they live in poor living conditions. They live where there are a lot of bus depots and Taxi depots where lost of cars are running a Spewing out emissions all the time and there is a connection, we know that. And I know, having worked for the last 6 years, on behalf of the victims of 911: firefighters, police officers and others who have been severely affected by what they breathed that day. How anyone could argue that what we breathe does not affect our health, after 911, is just impossible to understand. And we now have people who are dying because of their exposure on 911. So the debate should be over about environmental effects. Clean air is good for us on many levels. But it is especially good for our health; it is especially good for our children's health.
Council member Sandra Mack added, "Throughout her career in public service, Hillary has been a champion for issues important to women and families at home and around the world – including economic equality, education and equal, human rights for all. I'm delighted to play a strategic role in Nevada to make history, by electing Hillary Clinton our next president."
Manchester, NH - The New Hampshire for Hillary campaign today announced the endorsement of education leader Karen McDonough. McDonough, who led the National Education Association of New Hampshire (NEA-NH) for 16 years, joins the campaign as Co-chair of Education Leaders for Hillary. Special guest Iowans for Hillary Co-chair Christie Vilsack, who joined Karen on a conference call today, highlighted Senator Clinton's bold plan to make sure that every child in America has access to quality pre-kindergarten in this country.
"Senator Clinton's passion for improving the education system in this country is clear," said Karen McDonough. "Her work to see that programs such as Head Start and No Child Left Behind receive full funding, and her determination to make higher education more affordable and accessible, speaks to her commitment to the issue."
"Hillary Clinton understands the importance of early childhood education and will bring people together to make sure our children have the education they deserve," said Christie Vilsack, a former teacher and librarian. "She has proposed a program to set American's children on the path to success by providing them with high-quality, universal pre-kindergarten."
"I am honored to have Karen's support. We have a shared passion and commitment to helping improve the lives of children everywhere no matter what," said Clinton. "She is so well respected among educators in the Granite State and her expertise and understanding of New Hampshire's education system will be an asset to my campaign."
Now, that might mean creating one-stop youth centers like those in Baltimore and Los Angeles where case managers work to connect young people with tutoring, job training, and other support services. It might mean strengthening alternative education and Career Academies, apprenticeships and skills training.
We also need to make sure our young people can get these jobs in the first place. Yes there are problems because of low education and low skills, lack of mentoring and networks. But let's be frank here. Some of those problems that stand in the way of young people and jobs is because of discrimination, plain and simple.
"As an educator, every day I see the impact of Hillary's work," said State Representative Mary Mascher of Iowa City. "Whether it is school lunches for low-income kids, more funding for education initiatives or making college more affordable for students, Hillary's work and dedication is impacting my community and the students I teach."
Harter serves on the boards of Lewis and Clark and Sophia Palmer, Risk Retention Groups. She also serves on the advisory boards of the Nevada Ballet Theater, Safe Nest, and Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Southern Nevada. A native of New York City, she is the author of numerous journal articles and published papers in English literature and higher education, and has co-authored two books on American writers.
"Carol Harter's dedication and leadership have really changed the educational and cultural landscape of our community," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "She is one of the smartest, hardest-working people I know – and also knows a thing or two about breaking glass ceilings herself. Her experience and strategic thinking will be incredibly valuable to the campaign in Nevada."
"Hillary Clinton is a smart, tough and tested leader who believes, as I do, that education is the foundation of a strong society," said Rogers. "Fixing our broken education system will help restore our nation to its place of prominence and leadership in the global marketplace. I know that as president, Senator Clinton will work to broaden access to education and empower innovation. Of all the great candidates in the field this year, she is the most prepared to get America back on track. She has my enthusiastic endorsement, and I'm proud to be a part of her leadership team in Nevada."
As Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education, Rogers serves as chief executive officer for the state's system of eight institutions of higher learning. An active supporter of higher education, he has served on numerous boards and executive committees for colleges and universities across the country.
Rogers and his wife, Beverly, have contributed or pledged more than $275 million to various colleges and universities. Their gift of $115 million to the University of Arizona College of Law is to date the largest gift to any American law school.

Hillary Clinton knows that we can both defend our country and the rights of our citizens to live lives of dignity with affordable health care for men and women and quality public education for our children. Together with her longstanding and vocal support of the State of Israel, Senator Clinton is the best candidate to hit the ground running on her first day in the White House and tackle those issues that matter so deeply to me and my constituents.
Earlier in the year, the problems in mortgages seemed limited mostly to subprime loans. According to the New York Times, nearly 14 percent of subprime borrowers were delinquent in the first quarter. Now, there is increasing evidence that problems have spread beyond just subprime mortgages. There were 1.3 million foreclosures last year, and there have been more than 900,000 foreclosure filings so far this year. In New Hampshire, there were approximately 150 foreclosure filings last year, but there were more than 1,400 in the first six months of this year. The home is the largest asset most people have. The loss of it affects everything from people's economic security, to their retirement plans, to their ability to pay for their children's education.
In her twelve years in the State Legislature, Sen. Kuehl has authored 160 bills that have been signed into law. She has championed gender-related issues, writing legislation establishing the rights contained in Roe vs. Wade in California statute, strengthening protection for domestic violence victims and their children, and prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender and disability in the workplace and sexual orientation in education. She has also authored legislation establishing paid family leave, overhauling California's child support services system, establishing nurse to patient ratios in every hospital, increasing the rights of crime victims, and safeguarding the environment and drinking water.
Mayor Newsom has embraced brought fresh ideas and renewed energy to the City of San Francisco since he was elected in 2003. He has earned a reputation as an innovator on issues ranging from equality to homelessness. He has also championed important issues such as the environment, healthcare, and education.
Hillary Clinton outlined several key initiatives including her pre-K program and discussed the importance of early education that can help put children on the right path to a successful and productive life.
With respect to violence and re-entry, Hillary Clinton discussed her youth opportunity agenda and the importance of education. Clinton discussed the disproportionate number of men of color who are in prison, and how to ensure that they succeed when they are released. She outlined options including providing more vocational programs that train people who are returning to the workforce. The Senator noted that many industries, such as the auto and airline industry, have a shortage of trained workers and it would be wise to create and expand training programs for people who are unemployed so they can fill positions in these industries.
She also noted weaknesses in the Bush Administration, pointing to how they eliminated education programs in prison that would help people find work after their release, and also how the current administration did not do more to get guns off the street.
"Senator Clinton has an excellent concept about how she plans to address issues surrounding crime and education. She described how she has partnered with leaders in New York to create a charter school specifically for African American men and notes that the Allen Cathedral AME Church charter school in Jamaica Queens, New York could be used as a model of how to help educate African American young men. Her mentioning of the school shows that she's aware of outstanding successful examples of education in this country. The way she addressed the need for the federal government to partner with inner cities suggests that she's not just focusing on international issues but that she's concerned with domestic ones - particularly crime and violence in our communities. I want a president who knows how to strike a balance between addressing international and domestic challenges facing this country," said Reverend Dr. Harold R. Mayberry, Senior Pastor of First African Methodist Episcopal Church and Chairperson of Network for Interfaith Action.
Assemblyman Solorio, Chairman of the Assembly Public Safety Committee, represents the 69th District of California. Throughout his term, Solorio has been an advocate for the fight against gang violence. He noted Senator Clinton's approach to healthcare and education is commendable and corresponds with much of his own platform.
"I am pleased to endorse Senator Hillary Clinton in her bid for the Democrat nomination for President of the United States," said Rice. "Her work with farmers in upstate New York, creating new markets for their products, is an indicator of her commitment to the interests of the ranching and agricultural communities of rural Nevada. Hillary Clinton has lent a thoughtful ear to the discussion of mining issues. She supports revising the 1872 Mining Law, and she understands the importance of access to the vast mineral resources throughout the region. Her commitment to strengthening access to broadband communication systems throughout the rural United States will be vital to economic diversification and to increasing access to higher education for all."
"Hillary understands a student's education is critical to their development and as president, she will put the interests of our children first by funding and reforming No Child Left Behind," said Connie Gronstal. "Her 35 years of advocacy and service make her the most qualified candidate to help our children, and because Hillary Clinton is working for us, I am working for her."
"I am honored to have the support of these incredible Iowa educators in our effort to repair our struggling education system," said Senator Clinton. "American children deserve the opportunity to live up to their potential and a high quality education system is essential to achieving that goal."
For 35 years, Senator Clinton has advocated for children and families in America. In the Senate, Hillary Clinton has fought for universal pre-kindergarten and to make college more affordable for working families. As president she will fund and fix No Child Left Behind by tailoring the program to communities' individual needs, and targeting the most struggling schools with interventions that work. Hillary is the most qualified candidate to improve our education system and on her first day in the oval office, she will use that experience to create a better future for our children.
That's why I have proposed providing family members the education and training they need to help their loved ones with TBI and giving them the option to become certified caretakers and paying them for providing this care for their own family members.
The original GI Bill of Rights was one of the VFW's signature accomplishments. It didn't just help a generation of veterans build their lives â€“ it helped a generation of Americans build a thriving middle class. So I take personal pride, tremendous personal pride in the fact that the VFW has endorsed my GI Bill of Rights. And I want to pay tribute to my House sponsor, young Congressman from Pennsylvania Patrick Murphy. I met Patrick Murphy when he was a Captain in the 82nd Airborne in Baghdad in 2003 when I was there on my first trip. That was still a time when we could get out of the green zone, we went to Sadr City, and we met with members of the 82nd, one of whom was this bright young Captain named Patrick Murphy. When he left the army he decided to continue his public service in another way. He ran for, and won, a seat in Congress. So when I was thinking about what kind of Bill of Rights, a GI Bill of Rights we needed for the twenty-first century, he was one of the first calls I made â€“ because he had lived it. And together, our bill provides educational opportunities â€“ from college, to trade and technical training, to certification and licensing programs. It expands opportunities for veterans to buy, build, repair and improve their homes. It creates a Veterans Micro-loaning Program to provide loans up to $100,000 at very low interest rates and without collateral, so that veterans can start their own small businesses. And I appreciate your support and we are going to get it done together.
Fourth, I want to transform the bureaucracy, we have a 20th century veterans' infrastructure and we need a 21st century system. I will do it by appointing a single, high-level experienced veteran, in the White House, reporting directly to me responsible for streamlining and coordinating all health care, educational and career programs for veterans. The reason I recommend this is because my last trip to Ft. Drum, I spoke to 50 of our 10th Mountain Division soldiers who had just came back from Afghanistan, all of whom had been wounded. The Department of Defense wasn't talking to the VA, the medical records at DOD didn't find them their way to the VA, and this made no sense to me at all. We need a single seamless system, and the way to get it done is to have someone in the White House reporting to the President, who will drive every single agency of this government to take care of every one of our veterans, the way they deserve to be taken care of.
That begins with ensuring that America does have the world's strongest and smartest military force. We've begun to change tactics in Iraq, and in some areas particularly in Al Anbar province it's working; we're just years too late changing our tactics. We can't ever let that happen again. We can't be fighting the last warâ€”we have to be preparing to fight the new war and this new war requires different tactics and strategies. We have to be prepared to maintain the best fighting force in the world. I proposed increasing the size of our army by 80,000 soldiers, balancing the legacy systems with newer programs to help us keep our technological edge, reevaluating the training and education programs that servicemembers need in the 21st century. And let's be sure that the American military does not fight terrorism alone. It is time that we demanded that our alliances, including NATO, are united with us in this fight and that their intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security systems are working together with ours. And let's not forget, that the War on Terror like the Cold War is fundamentally a battle over ideas and values.
"As the first lady of Arkansas, I watched Hillary Clinton stand up for working families by helping to organize Arkansas Advocates for Children and families and leading a taskforce to improve education standards across our great state," Beebe said. "As a Senator I have applauded her work to strengthen the Children's Health Insurance program, which increases coverage for our children in low income and working families.
Council member Sandra Mack added, "Throughout her career in public service, Hillary has been a champion for issues important to women and families at home and around the world – including economic equality, education and equal, human rights for all. I'm delighted to play a strategic role in Nevada to make history, by electing Hillary Clinton our next president."
"I truly believe Hillary Clinton has the necessary experience, dedication and commitment to lead our country in the right direction," said State Representative Martin David Kiar of Broward County. "Senator Clinton understands the issues affecting Floridians, from establishing a national catastrophic insurance fund to reforming and properly supporting our education system, she will fight for what's important to us."
Murray is the first woman elected as President of the Massachusetts Senate, and had formerly chaired the Senate Committee on Ways and Means. Currently serving her eighth term, President Murray was first elected to the Senate in 1992 to represent Plymouth and Barnstable. Throughout her career, Murray has been a tireless advocate for affordable, quality health care, serving as one of the six legislators to negotiate the compromise that lead to Massachusetts' historic health care reform law. Murray has also been an unwavering voice for improving public education from pre-kindergarten through college, increasing economic and workforce development opportunities, and expanding affordable housing.
"Hillary Clinton earned the IAM's endorsement by focusing on jobs, health care, education and trade - the bread and butter issues of the American middle class," said IAM International President Tom Buffenbarger. "She is the only candidate of either party to come forward with a comprehensive manufacturing policy and the only candidate to connect with millions of Americans who feel invisible to the current administration."
The IAM will launch a massive education campaign among IAM members and extensive publicity in union publications and websites nationwide. Twenty-five states with over 450,000 active and retired IAM members will vote in the three weeks starting with the Iowa caucuses and ending with the polls closing in California on February 5th.

"Senator Clinton is the most qualified candidate in this exceptional field," said Horne. "She could walk into the Oval Office today and immediately begin the work of setting our country in the right direction. She has a clear vision for the future, and has her finger on the pulse of the most critical issues we face. Most of Nevada's families are working families – and Senator Clinton has throughout her career fought to make sure working families can meet their needs. They are concerned about how to afford their house payments and their health care – with saving money for their children's education, and for retirement. I know that Hillary will prioritize these issues that are so critical to Nevadans, and to all Americans."

"I believe Hillary Clinton has what it takes to get us out of Iraq and back on track in tackling our real priorities," said Portland City Commissioner Erik Sten. "Our families need healthcare, early education and jobs that make a living wage. By investing in American ingenuity to stop global warming, we can build an economy and place in the world that is sustainable. Hillary will do the hard work in Washington that we need to be successful in Oregon."
Delegate Lee represents Montgomery County and has been a leader on preventing Internet crimes and exploitation. She has also worked hard to sponsor and support legislation to ensure a quality education for all children, affordable and quality health care, clean environment, gun control, increased procurement opportunities for women and minority owned small businesses, and to fight domestic violence, senior and child abuse, hate crimes and drunk driving.
No school should ever have a culture like this. Students deserve the right to get an education without being afraid of the very people who are put in place to protect them.

  " Students deserve the right to get an education without being afraid of the very people who are put in place to protect them."
"I've had the honor of working with Hillary as a First Lady, Senator and Secretary of State, and in each role she has shown the leadership, values and concrete plans that make her the best choice to be our next president," said Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, IL. "Hillary has been a steadfast and progressive voice on the issues that matter most – creating jobs, expanding high-quality education options, investing in America's crumbling infrastructure and cracking down on illegal guns. I'm with Hillary and will be working tirelessly over the next year to make sure she is given the opportunity to lead this great country."
And when they are not in school or at work, what are they doing? And—and plus, they're in underserved communities. And so my question to you is, what is your stance on supporting young people who really need opportunity, and more resources out there for better education, as well as better employment? And what will you do as president to help support those 5.6 million young people around the nation who it is affecting? Yeah. [applause]
What is it that can be done for John or Mary or whomever? So we need to support nonprofit groups, advocacy groups, organizing groups, faith communities to do this work. But secondly, we have to take a hard look. And one of the ideas that I have been thinking about is we take a hard look at communities where you have very persistent poverty, poor education outcomes, other kinds of indicators of problems.
And it will work, because what we are going to do is to focus on it being a compact between the federal government and state governments, and institutions. Because I do think that colleges and universities have to take a really hard look at what they are spending money on. [applause] So, that they make sure what they are spending on is related to helping prepare a student for life, for profession or career. I think states have dis-invested in higher education. A lot of the money that states use to put into colleges and universities has gone into everything from prisons to roads, you name it.
So, we got to figure out how the state does more of its fair share. I think that in order for it to be debt free, families above a certain income level will have to continue to fund college. I think that's only fair. And I want students to work 10 hours a week. Because I want students to know they are working for their education. And that it's something they really value. [applause]
And we've got a good G.I. bill now coming after 9/11—a new G.I. bill for the new generation of vets, but I want to make sure they don't get ripped off because sometimes that veteran education money is going to institutions that don't really serve them well. So we have some work to do to make sure that it is done right.
And it really is quite disturbing to me that we have had, as everybody knows in the last several years, because of the great recession, mostly—we've had really low interest rates. And yet, when I ask students what interest rate they are paying on their debt, lots of them are paying six, seven, eight, nine, 10 percent. Some of it private, some of it to the government. And I do not believe the federal government should be making a profit off of lending money to students to be able to go get a college education. [applause]
As millions of Americans can personally attest, student debt and the high cost of college are holding too many people back. That's why President Obama acted to help millions of borrowers with direct student loans from the federal government by allowing them to cap their monthly payments at 10 percent of their income. And the Department of Education is currently changing its regulations to make a "pay as you earn" plan broadly available within the next year—which would benefit millions more. We need to do more to help students and their families afford higher education—not undo these important steps while the cost of college skyrockets.

And I particularly want a comprehensive health analysis of what's happened to these children. Lead is a poison. It destroys your brain. It interferes with your learning and your behavior. Whatever it takes for Michigan and the federal government to come together, through FEMA, through Health and Human Services, the EPA, whatever it takes, we now have to fix the problem and help these kids and especially their health and education development probably for years to come.
Making college affordable isn't just a campaign promise for Hillary—she's been working on it since her days as first lady of Arkansas. She helped found the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, which has helped more than 38,000 people attend college. Then, as a U.S. senator, she introduced legislation to give students the option of income-based loan repayment. She also introduced a bill to make Pell Grants available year-round, so nontraditional students could afford to pursue their education during the summer months. And she co-sponsored legislation to help student borrowers refinance their loans.
"Planned Parenthood has issued its first-ever primary endorsement of Hillary because she's been fighting for women and families her entire life. In Arkansas, she launched the first rape crisis hotline in the state. In the Senate, she fought tirelessly for reproductive rights, access to birth control, and sex education. As secretary of state, women's health and women's rights were the centerpiece of her agenda. All that experience means that Hillary has the skills and the scars that no one else can match. She is the strongest, most qualified candidate for the office of president that I have ever encountered. But in an election, she'll only be as powerful as those who stand with her."
"Her commitment to promoting policies to develop alternative energy technologies and fighting global warming are only two of the many issues in which Hillary has shown her ability to lead. Senator Clinton also has a long record of working on issues that are important to women and to Latino families, such as education, healthcare and economic empowerment. I look forward to working to help elect Hillary the next president of the United States."
Mr. Congressman over there, are you in favor of clean energy and affordable college? Are you in favor of early childhood education and the way we're going to get it is to tax the two people in your district who make more than $5 million? Or are you going to deny that to the 350,000 people who live in your district?
Myra was the type of person who would rather go without than deny help to a person in need. She believed that everything was possible through God, education, and family.
"She loved everything Mrs. Clinton stands for," Kevin says. "Hillary is a person that seems to be very serious about her business. They had that in common. And both have strong views about the need for a strong education system, to put kids on the right path in life."
Every day, Kevin and Denise honor their mother's legacy by lending a helping hand to anyone in need. Kevin runs a nonprofit called Passion to Forgive, which focuses on youth education, and Denise gives guidance to kids in her community.
Since the late 1800s, African Americans have been fighting for the right to vote—and today, we are still fighting for that sacred right. In the 1950s and 60s we fought to give our children a quality education while a majority of black children were limited to poor segregated schools, and we fought to end the scourge of racism that gripped our country.
Hillary Clinton is standing up for our children and has a bold vision that protects them; eliminates the school-to-prison pipeline; improves our education system; and enhances the opportunities for women. Our economic and criminal justice systems remain stacked against the most vulnerable people in our society, and young men of color are the unfortunate recipients of these injustices. Our youth are our future and must be protected. In the Senate, Hillary Clinton sponsored legislation to ban racial profiling, prosecute hate crimes, and eliminate race-based disparities in our health care system. She is making progress.

  " The frustration over the economic recovery that benefits too few Americans, the shortcomings of health care reform and the high cost of college education is genuine. So are the concerns about global terrorism, personal security at home and the nation's relationships with old adversaries abroad. ... Clinton is clearly the best prepared to achieve results in each of those areas."

  " Clinton has a long list of sound policy proposals, from aiming for a cure for Alzheimer's to campaign finance reform, climate change, early education, higher education, the economy, gun violence, immigration, racial justice, Social Security, veterans, workforce skills and more."
The Court?"made same-sex marriage legal nationwide, preserved the Affordable Care Act—not once, but twice—and ensured equal access to education for women," Hillary said. However, it also "cut the heart out of the Voting Rights Act. It overturned commonsense laws addressing gun violence."?
So we gathered facts, we built a coalition and our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. It's a big idea, isn't it? Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school.
Because we changed our law to make sure she got an education. So it's true. I sweat the details of policy, whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Michigan, the number of mental health facilities in Iowa or the cost of your prescription drugs.
Next, getting an education should give you a boost, not hold you back. But as you know better than most, tuition keeps going through the roof and debt keeps piling up. I understand that Temple was founded to democratize, diversify and widen the reach of higher education. That is still a vital goal.
The second woman I want to tell you about is Marian Wright Edelman. She was a lawyer for the NAACP in Mississippi, first African American woman to pass the Mississippi bar. She was an ally of Dr. King and Robert Kennedy, and the founder of the Children's Defense Fund, an altogether remarkable person. One day during my first semester in law school, I saw a flyer – we used to have those, flyers on a campus bulletin board. And Marian was coming to give a lecture. I made sure to be there, and what I heard was captivating. Marian talked about creating a Head Start program in Mississippi and using her legal education to make life better for poor children and families. Something just clicked in my brain. I began to see how I could translate the commitment to helping others I'd learned from my mother, my church, into real social change. I went up to her and I said, 'Could I work for you this summer?' She said, 'Sure, but I can't pay you.' I said, 'Well, I am paying my way through law school, so I have to get paid.' She said, 'Well, if you can figure out how to get paid, you can have a job.' So I figured out how to get a grant to get paid and went to work for her.
After graduation, I could have followed my classmates to a high-powered law firm, but I went to work for Marian at the Children's Defense Fund instead. She sent me door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school back then. And I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted an education, but it just didn't seem possible. My heart went out to her and I wanted to help. But it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. That wouldn't force the public school to build more wheelchair ramps or put more resources into special education. I learned that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. So we gathered evidence. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. And that experience turned me into a lifelong advocate for children and families.
So here's what I think we need to do, and it's not a luxury, it's a necessity – because I want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them. And I've heard so many stories. They've told me – people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses they're under. So let's finally, since every other advanced economy has already done this, let's have paid family leave so that when you're sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn, you can take care of your loved ones. And let's have earned sick days so that you don't lose your job because you're sick or you go to work because you're sick. And let's finally have affordable childcare, which in lots of states costs as much or more than in-state college tuition. I don't think any family should ever have to pay more than 10 percent of your income for childcare, and we're going to fix that so that becomes the norm. And then let's make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget.
So I'm excited about what we can do. I really am. And I'm going to leave it to the fact-checkers to go through all of – all of Donald Trump's claims. There were – there was a lot of work for fact-checkers last night. But here's a couple of things that caught my attention. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes. In fact, I think there's a strong probability he hasn't paid federal taxes a lot of years. And this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster; who goes around criticizing every institution, from health care to education, our vets. But he probably hasn't paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems.
And when I confronted him with the reasons why he won't release his tax returns – and I got to that point where I said, well, maybe he's paid zero – he said that makes him smart. Now, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us? I got to tell you, Bill and I have been blessed. We didn't come from millionaire families. My husband's father – his biological father died before he was born. His mother went to nursing school in order to support him. They struggled. They worked hard. And America gave him the chance to get a good education, pursue his dreams, end up being President. My dad, as I told you, worked hard.
That starts with being honest. Being unafraid to face the facts. Face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped, searched by police, charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing. We need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses. We need to make sure our police officers are trained in de-escalating tense situations. We need to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education. And yes we have got to fight for common sense reforms to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our communities.
We're also going to strengthen education at every level starting with universal pre-kindergarten education.
And we want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so that every kid gets a world class education. I want us to bring back technical education in high school. I think it was a mistake when we took it out of our high schools.
So I hope that as we move through these next 18 days, everyone thinks seriously about what you really want to see, not just in your next president, but in your lives, in your jobs, in your education, in our future together.
And you deserve a senator who would never support cutting $360 million from Florida's schools, because Patrick knows every child in Florida deserves a world-class education. So my friends, Patrick Murphy is a smart, tough-minded legislator and an independent voice.

And we're also going to strengthen education at every level, starting with universal pre-K, and working -- working with our teachers to make sure every child has a good school with good teachers in every zip code. And here's what I want all the students to hear, we're going to make college more affordable for everyone.

And I also want more pathways to good jobs that don't require a four-year college de-gree. Let's return technical education to high schools. Let's do more with our community colleges. Let's have more apprenticeship programs so that everybody has a chance at a good job.

Make sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun. And you can go to iwillvote.com to find your nearest early voting location because, make no mistake, whatever issue you care about – I've only mentioned a few tonight, but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot. Now, it may be my name and my opponent's name, but where we stand on these issues, what we've done in the past, what we have said we want to do in the future, that is all on the ballot. The future of our economy is at stake, of our education system is at stake. Fighting climate change and clean, renewable-energy jobs are at stake. LGBT equality is at stake. Equal pay for women is at stake. Actually, in the end, the American dream itself is at stake. So I want you to think about how you will feel on November 9th.
Now, every time I see him, which is not often enough, we always have a good conversation like we did before this event. He always gets you to think. Not only is he a world-class talent, but he is a passionate advocate for issues that are too often overlooked and ignored. He wants to -- and I'm going to do everything I can help him -- to deliver -- giving kids who are at risk access to educational and arts programs that they deserve to have just as much as any other child.

Well, I'm glad to hear that because it's time you had a governor who puts families first, not radical ideology.And I love seeing our educators stand up and applaud because you need a governor who actually cares about the education of the children of North Carolina.

But I don't think that every young person needs to go college. If you want to, I'm going to make it affordable for you, but if you also want some other way of making a good living, let's bring technical education back into high schools and connect them up with community colleges and business apprenticeships.

And we're going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers, no matter what zip code that child lives in. And I want to start with our youngest kids, with pre-kindergarten programs. And then I want to be a good partner with our teachers. We've got to have high expectation and get results in helping our children. And I want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them.

"We should put politics aside and unite behind a common goal: helping women prevent unintended pregnancies in the first place. Through access to education, contraception, and quality healthcare we can empower women to make safe, affordable, evidence-based family planning decisions," said Senator Clinton.
"Today, Equal Pay Day, we recognize this distressing gap and the impact it has on our families. Working women -- our neighbors -- do not get a discount on essentials for their families, costs like food, rent, healthcare or education," said Florida Arthenia Joyner. "Senator Clinton is taking a leadership role in addressing this issue in Congress, and I urge others to support her."
"Senator Clinton's pre-K proposal shows she understands that the wisest investment we can make for the future of our country is the investment we make in our children's education," New Hampshire House Majority Leader Mary Jane Wallner, who has been a prominent early childcare advocate in New Hampshire for decades and Director of the Merrimack Valley Day Care in Concord, NH. "Brain research has shown that developmentally appropriate early education programs help young children obtain the skills they will need to be successful in school."
"Senator Clinton's plan is a pro-active, detailed approach to Early Childhood Education and clearly shows Hillary's commitment to education," said Marilyn St. George, a former Reading Recovery teacher and literacy specialist who teaches third grade at Wilkins Elementary School in Amherst, NH. "This initiative reaffirms for me the respect that Senator Clinton has shown in the past for educators. Requiring highly qualified teachers to teach four-year-olds is essential as young children are at a crucial developmental stage and need and deserve the very best we have to offer."
"Every child - not just children whose parents can afford it - should have the same chance to succeed and to fulfill his or her God-given potential," Clinton said. "As President, I will establish universal pre-kindergarten education through a federal-state partnership, based on state flexibility that ensures every four-year-old child in America has access to a high-quality pre-kindergarten program."
The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) in a statement yesterday welcomed Clinton's pre-K Plan. "Sen. Hillary Clinton knows what we at the AFT know: Children's success in school starts long before they enter a kindergarten classroom. Our country has long needed—and the AFT has long called for—a universal pre-kindergarten program. We commend Sen. Clinton for choosing early childhood education as the focus of the first major education initiative of her presidential campaign."
The AFT represents 1.4 million pre-K through 12th-grade teachers; paraprofessionals and other school-related personnel; higher education faculty and professional staff; nurses and healthcare workers; and federal, state and local government employees.
"It is so important that children entering First Grade are fully ready to learn and it is essential it is for preschool to be available to all children," said St. George. "A quality preschool program provides the child with their very first educational experience and can be the catalyst that transforms a child to 'learner' early-on. If this stage of learning is given the importance that is necessary, the child will become a lifelong learner who is also enthusiastic and confident."
As a Senator, Hillary has championed legislation that will help create good jobs, develop new sources of capital, and invest in education, healthcare, broadband, agriculture, biofuels and other renewable energy sources in order to grow the economies of rural America. Senator Clinton has been a tireless advocate of restoring the promise of rural and small town America. She has worked to expand access to broadband and spur innovative strategies for rural economic development. In a major speech last year, Senator Clinton addressed the many challenges facing rural communities and called for new strategies to preserve the quality of life and keep good jobs in rural and small-town communities.
Well, thank you very, very, much. I am delighted to be back at GW and I want to thank President Trachtenberg for his kind introduction, but he and his wife Francine have been leading advocates on behalf of higher education and so many other issues for as long as I've known them, and that goes back many years. And as Joel said, we shared the experience of our children in high school, and that was indeed an experience we both survived, so we're grateful to tell the tale.
As I travel around America, I have talked with people from all walks of life about the challenges that our country is facing: from ending the war in Iraq to ending our dependence on foreign oil -- from improving our education system to reducing our deficit. And no matter where I go or with whom I talk -- whether it's small business owners or CEOs, doctors or nurses or patients -- I hear growing concern about the crisis in our health care system: exploding costs, declining coverage and shortcoming in care and prevention.
Clinton has been a longtime advocate for veterans, calling attention to Gulf War Syndrome as First Lady, and leading efforts in Congress to provide life-saving armor for our troops and their vehicles in Iraq. She recently proposed a new GI Bill of Rights, which would expand opportunities for veterans to pursue education and home ownership and provide low-interest loans to start their own businesses. Her bill would also cut red tape for military personnel to receive the benefits and the healthcare they need, and crack down on predatory lenders who target military families.

Hillary Clinton laid out her progressive vision for strengthening the middle class in the face of rising income inequality and globalization today. In a speech at the Manchester School of Technology in New Hampshire, she called for a return to shared prosperity and tax fairness, while expanding access to quality education and healthcare for all Americans.
Villaraigosa and Clinton announced the endorsement after a tour of the preschool at UCLA's Krieger Center, where Clinton discussed her plan to provide pre-K access to all American children, including the more than 90% of California 4-year-olds who are not enrolled in a state pre-K program. Both Mayor Villaraigosa and Senator Clinton believe that a quality education begins with access to preschool and ensuring that students are educated by highly-trained teachers. They share the belief that every four-year old -- not just those whose parents can afford it -- should have the same opportunity to fulfill their full potential.
Villaraigosa was elected Mayor in 2005, and immediately set about tackling the toughest challenges facing Los Angeles. Since assuming office, he has championed an education reform plan that puts students first, ensures greater accountability in the schools, and gives principals, teachers, and parents more control over their campuses. He has accelerated the city's use of renewable energy to 35% by 2020, secured funding for 1,000 new police officers, and deployed a comprehensive strategy to combat gang violence. Villaraigosa has also focused on quality of life issues, increasing funding for affordable housing, implementing common sense strategies to reduce traffic gridlock and funding basic city services at historic highs.
Lansing civic leader and Michigan State Trustee Joel Ferguson said, "Hillary Clinton has devoted her life to expanding opportunity for all Americans. She is a leader Michigan can trust to address our priorities -- strengthening our economy, creating and protecting jobs, improving education and demanding universal healthcare. Hillary has been tackling the tough issues facing our country for three decades. No one would be a better partner for Michigan and its workers, and no one is better prepared to be President."
"Hillary Clinton has devoted her life to helping others," Dinkins said. "From healthcare to education to caring for our veterans, she has been a champion for the millions of Americans who have been invisible to this administration. Her depth of experience and her strength of character make her uniquely suited to be President."
"I am demonstrating my support for Senator Clinton's presidential bid by serving on the National Mayors Council," said Mayor Johnson, who will serve as one of 11 council co-chairs. "I am a firm believer that Senator Clinton's experience, intelligence and compassion will serve as galvanizing forces to change course and lead our country in the right direction. As president, Senator Clinton will fight to ensure that Americans living in rural communities like Lovelock, have equal access to affordable healthcare, good education and other programs to make the United States and its citizens the strongest they can be."
"Senator Clinton's unmatched experience makes her the most qualified candidate to be our next President," said Vermont State Senator Hinda Miller. "People throughout the county, including those right here in Vermont, will benefit from the Senator's commitment to government reform, repairing our healthcare system, and providing affordable quality education.
Mayor Newsom has embraced brought fresh ideas and renewed energy to the City of San Francisco since he was elected in 2003. He has earned a reputation as an innovator on issues ranging from equality to homelessness. He has also championed important issues such as the environment, healthcare, and education.
Earvin Johnson, Jr. is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Magic Johnson Enterprises (MJE) which owns and/or operates business ventures across 89 cities and 22 states. Through MJE, Mr. Johnson has bolstered the economy by establishing brand name businesses in underserved communities, training and hiring local residents and employing local contractors. As Chairman and Founder of the Magic Johnson Foundation, Mr. Johnson continues to work to improve the educational, health, and social needs of children, young adults and inner-city communities throughout the nation.
Hillary Clinton outlined several key initiatives including her pre-K program and discussed the importance of early education that can help put children on the right path to a successful and productive life.
With respect to violence and re-entry, Hillary Clinton discussed her youth opportunity agenda and the importance of education. Clinton discussed the disproportionate number of men of color who are in prison, and how to ensure that they succeed when they are released. She outlined options including providing more vocational programs that train people who are returning to the workforce. The Senator noted that many industries, such as the auto and airline industry, have a shortage of trained workers and it would be wise to create and expand training programs for people who are unemployed so they can fill positions in these industries.
She also noted weaknesses in the Bush Administration, pointing to how they eliminated education programs in prison that would help people find work after their release, and also how the current administration did not do more to get guns off the street.
"Senator Clinton has an excellent concept about how she plans to address issues surrounding crime and education. She described how she has partnered with leaders in New York to create a charter school specifically for African American men and notes that the Allen Cathedral AME Church charter school in Jamaica Queens, New York could be used as a model of how to help educate African American young men. Her mentioning of the school shows that she's aware of outstanding successful examples of education in this country. The way she addressed the need for the federal government to partner with inner cities suggests that she's not just focusing on international issues but that she's concerned with domestic ones - particularly crime and violence in our communities. I want a president who knows how to strike a balance between addressing international and domestic challenges facing this country," said Reverend Dr. Harold R. Mayberry, Senior Pastor of First African Methodist Episcopal Church and Chairperson of Network for Interfaith Action.
Assemblyman Solorio, Chairman of the Assembly Public Safety Committee, represents the 69th District of California. Throughout his term, Solorio has been an advocate for the fight against gang violence. He noted Senator Clinton's approach to healthcare and education is commendable and corresponds with much of his own platform.
That's why I have proposed providing family members the education and training they need to help their loved ones with TBI and giving them the option to become certified caretakers and paying them for providing this care for their own family members.
The original GI Bill of Rights was one of the VFW's signature accomplishments. It didn't just help a generation of veterans build their lives â€“ it helped a generation of Americans build a thriving middle class. So I take personal pride, tremendous personal pride in the fact that the VFW has endorsed my GI Bill of Rights. And I want to pay tribute to my House sponsor, young Congressman from Pennsylvania Patrick Murphy. I met Patrick Murphy when he was a Captain in the 82nd Airborne in Baghdad in 2003 when I was there on my first trip. That was still a time when we could get out of the green zone, we went to Sadr City, and we met with members of the 82nd, one of whom was this bright young Captain named Patrick Murphy. When he left the army he decided to continue his public service in another way. He ran for, and won, a seat in Congress. So when I was thinking about what kind of Bill of Rights, a GI Bill of Rights we needed for the twenty-first century, he was one of the first calls I made â€“ because he had lived it. And together, our bill provides educational opportunities â€“ from college, to trade and technical training, to certification and licensing programs. It expands opportunities for veterans to buy, build, repair and improve their homes. It creates a Veterans Micro-loaning Program to provide loans up to $100,000 at very low interest rates and without collateral, so that veterans can start their own small businesses. And I appreciate your support and we are going to get it done together.
Fourth, I want to transform the bureaucracy, we have a 20th century veterans' infrastructure and we need a 21st century system. I will do it by appointing a single, high-level experienced veteran, in the White House, reporting directly to me responsible for streamlining and coordinating all health care, educational and career programs for veterans. The reason I recommend this is because my last trip to Ft. Drum, I spoke to 50 of our 10th Mountain Division soldiers who had just came back from Afghanistan, all of whom had been wounded. The Department of Defense wasn't talking to the VA, the medical records at DOD didn't find them their way to the VA, and this made no sense to me at all. We need a single seamless system, and the way to get it done is to have someone in the White House reporting to the President, who will drive every single agency of this government to take care of every one of our veterans, the way they deserve to be taken care of.
That begins with ensuring that America does have the world's strongest and smartest military force. We've begun to change tactics in Iraq, and in some areas particularly in Al Anbar province it's working; we're just years too late changing our tactics. We can't ever let that happen again. We can't be fighting the last warâ€”we have to be preparing to fight the new war and this new war requires different tactics and strategies. We have to be prepared to maintain the best fighting force in the world. I proposed increasing the size of our army by 80,000 soldiers, balancing the legacy systems with newer programs to help us keep our technological edge, reevaluating the training and education programs that servicemembers need in the 21st century. And let's be sure that the American military does not fight terrorism alone. It is time that we demanded that our alliances, including NATO, are united with us in this fight and that their intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security systems are working together with ours. And let's not forget, that the War on Terror like the Cold War is fundamentally a battle over ideas and values.
But when I talk about supporting providers, I'm not just talking about doctors -- but about nurses as well. And that's the third step in my plan -- to immediately address our nursing shortage and to give nurses the training and educational and support that they need to provide the care patients deserve.
"I believe Hillary Clinton has what it takes to get us out of Iraq and back on track in tackling our real priorities," said Portland City Commissioner Erik Sten. "Our families need healthcare, early education and jobs that make a living wage. By investing in American ingenuity to stop global warming, we can build an economy and place in the world that is sustainable. Hillary will do the hard work in Washington that we need to be successful in Oregon."
The Clinton Campaign announced today the endorsement of U.S. Rep. Laura Richardson of Los Angeles. Senator Clinton and Congresswoman Richardson share many issues and initiatives; however Senator Clinton's commitment to equitable access to public education, healthcare, job creation, and economic development earned her the Congresswoman's full endorsement.
"After having worked in corporate America before serving at the local, state, and now Federal level of government, and having participated in California's Presidential legislative briefings, I am fully persuaded that Senator Clinton is the best qualified candidate to be President in 2008," said Congresswoman Richardson. "Whether it is education, creating good paying jobs, sustaining American businesses, or empowering our community, Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to bring the change California families and urban communities need."
In 2006, then Long Beach City Councilwoman Richardson won a seat in the California State Assembly in the 55th District and served as the Assistant Speaker pro Tempore in the Assembly and was recognized as the first African-American woman, South Bay representative, and freshman to hold this prestigious position. In the state legislature, Richardson was dedicated to expanding access to healthcare, empowering public education, and ensuring safe neighborhoods. More recently, Richardson succeeded 16 candidates in a special election to represent the culturally and economically diverse constituents of California's 37th Congressional District.
"I had the opportunity to attend an event in my district where Senator Clinton spoke with community residents at King/Drew Magnet High School and the Charles Drew University about issues important to my constituents, including job creation, education, economic development and public safety," Assemblyman Dymally said. "The answers Senator Clinton provided and the connection she was able to make with the audience convinced me that Senator Hillary Clinton is the candidate with the strength and experience to make the changes our communities need and want."
"During her time in the Senate, Hillary Clinton has been a leader in addressing the nursing shortage and has worked to secure increased funding for nursing education," said Margaret Franckhauser, RN, MS, MPH, of Meredith. "She understands the unique and vital role that nurses play in caring for so many people across the county. Hillary has shown that she believes an investment in nursing is truly an investment in the future of our health care system."
Senator Clinton has a proven record of working for America's nurses. She introduced the Nursing Education and Quality of Health Care Act, which aims to increase the nurse workforce in rural areas, expand nursing school faculty, and develop initiatives to integrate patient safety practices into nursing education. Hillary also authored a provision, which became law as part of the Nurse Reinvestment Act, to encourage the recruitment and retention of nurses and directs money to grants for nursing education and recruitment.
Hillary and I have worked together for many years. She has been a staunch advocate for children and helped California pass Proposition 10, which has provided almost $6 billion for early childhood health and education. As First Lady, she helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage to 6 million children; the Vaccines for Children program, which resulted in 90% of children receiving the vaccinations they need; and Early Head Start, which provides social services to infants and toddlers living in poverty. She has continued those efforts on the campaign trail by laying out a serious plan to provide high quality early childhood education to at risk young children, and a terrific plan to provide high quality health care to all Americans.
Currently, 1 in 3 women are unaware of emergency contraception; Murray, Clinton, Slaughter bill would initiate a large-scale education campaign
Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY) introduced Senate legislation that will raise awareness about the availability of emergency contraception also known as Plan B or the "morning-after" pill. The bill authorizes an education campaign to better inform women and healthcare providers of emergency contraception. Representative Louise Slaughter (D-NY) has already introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.
The program would provide a description of emergency contraception and an explanation of its use, safety, efficacy and availability to nonprofit organizations, consumer groups, institutions of higher education, Federal, State, or local agencies, clinics and the media.
So taken together, the pressures of stagnant wages; rising health, education, and energy costs; increased household debt; and a softening housing market are creating a trap door economy. Too many families are standing on that trap door, just one diagnosis, one pink slip, one missed mortgage payment away from falling through and losing everything they've worked for. They're bearing all of the risks of the global economy but reaping few of the rewards.
Think about Teddy Roosevelt busting the trusts and rooting out corruption. Franklin Roosevelt building the infrastructure that drove this century's economy. President Truman ensuring that American GIs had the tools they needed to seize the promise of a great and growing future. President Eisenhower supporting more science and math education. President Kennedy set our sights on the moon and President Johnson worked to end poverty and the insecurity that comes as we grow older.
We know that we've got to improve the skills and education of our workforce. But today, and I have to confess I was surprised, I asked to find out the statistic but even I was surprised. 75% of students at America's best public and private universities and colleges come from the top 25% of income in America. Think about that. So that leaves 25% for everybody else. Just 3% of the students come from the bottom 25% of income. It didn't used to be like this. We used to believe that if you worked hard and you were college material, you would go to college. We clearly need to make college accessible so that students from all different backgrounds have the chance to fulfill their God-given potential.
Senator Estabrook will serve as a Co-Chair of Educators for Hillary and will play an active role in the campaign reaching out to the education community and developing policy. She is currently serving her third term in the State Senate and has been prominent and outspoken advocate for early childhood education and a strong critic of the No Child Left Behind Act. She is the sponsor of the Granite State Scholars program, which created a joint partnership between the state and New Hampshire colleges to provide scholarships to students who qualified.
"Iris is passionate about early education and has spent her life working on behalf of New Hampshire families," Clinton said. "Her perspective and experience will be a great help to my campaign as I continue my conversation with Granite State educators, families and students throughout the state."
"Hillary cares about hardworking people and she has the experience to enact the reform this country needs from strengthening public education to providing affordable healthcare for every American and ensuring stronger security at home and abroad," Estabrook said.
In the New Hampshire Senate, Estabrook is the Chairwoman of the Education Committee and the Health and Human Services Committee. The senator is a former elementary school teacher and past director of the University of New Hampshire Child Care Resource and Referral Program. This session, Iris was the prime sponsor of Senate Bill 101 which increased funding for alternative education and vocational programs in school districts.
After we finish talking about college affordability we're going to throw it open for you to ask any questions you are interested in because I know how important this election is for the future and in fact it is probably more important for the future of the students here than for the rest of us because the next President will make decisions to chart the course of our country through much of the 21st century. Now I obviously believe that among the tasks of the next President will be reversing the damage that has been done by our current President. We won't be moving forward with confidence and competence into the future, tackling the challenges we face, understanding that there is no guarantee and we will remain a great nation with a growing economy and shared prosperity and the opportunities available that were present for previous generations unless we do the work that is necessary to make that happen. And one of the key to a strong and confident America is a system of higher education that is acceptable to all who are motivated to seek it out. And yet as I travel across our country, I have confirmation every day about how much more difficult it is for many students to afford to start college, continue college and graduate from college than it was 20 or 30 years ago. But I'd like to start off with a few questions. How many of you have ever worried about whether you could afford college or if your family members whether the young people in your family could afford college? How many of you have ever had to worry about that. That's a lot of hands. How many of you have taken out college loans. How many of you are totally baffled by the college loaned format?
Higher education has never been more of a financial burden, but in today's global economy it's never been more important. Graduates from four-year colleges earn nearly twice as much as high school graduates, an estimated $1 million more over a lifetime.
Forty-two percent of all new jobs this decade will require some post-secondary education. That's a big jump from even six and a half years ago, when it was only about 29 percent.
Our higher education system has historically been the envy of the world. We know that in other countries (inaudible) the future was determined at the age of 12 or 16. But they have changed, and they now value college much more, and the rates of young people going to college are actually higher than we have now in America. And China and India are not far behind.
When it comes to higher education, we should not be playing catch-up with the world, we should continue to be leading, because the skills and knowledge of our workforce will determine whether America can compete and win in the 21st century.
And we have all understood, for a long time, that (inaudible) college education is not the (inaudible) for all of us.
You know, when I was first lady in Arkansas I served as the founding board president of something called the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship program. The idea was to help single parents access higher education and better jobs so they could better provide for themselves and their children. (inaudible) that program in 2000 and found that 80 percent of the recipients have graduated and 92 percent have found employment that paid more than what they had before.
And then it goes on to say your school will use this number determine what types of aid and how much you are eligible for based on your educational (inaudible).
And I was very pleased today that (inaudible) AmeriCorps educational (inaudible).
And some provide a high quality education, yet, too often, they are treated like second-class citizens. If they're not four years as a college, even though they often provide a better education than some of our four-year colleges, they still don't get the respect and support they deserve.
Well being the youngest in my family I've always known that I wanted to go to college and it wasn't affordable for the rest of my family but they've always supported me and knew that I wanted to go. So my oldest brother decided to go into the military because after a few years out of high school he realized that he wanted to go back to school and he had no way afford it. So it was kind of a struggle for us watching him have to go into the Air Force and wonder what might happen because of the war and things like that. So we were kind of nervous, but glad that he went to school and we're glad that he's doing what he's doing. My other brother Chris went to a tech school and I'm very proud of him, and my brother Matt is actually going to school today at a technical college in Laconia and trying to get an education but it's still hard for us to afford it. And so I've been doing different programs trying to learn how to afford it. But there are some things as a high school student that I'm not really aware of, like the Pell Grants, which you mentioned. I mean, I've never heard of it and I'm sure that other students in my school haven't and other students around New Hampshire and the United States haven't heard of different programs and scholarships that students can get to afford school. So I'm really interested in how to pay.
Kim Beauregard: There's a student educational talent search for families that are financially stable but might not have the money to pay 50,000 dollars for school, and they brought us around to the different colleges in New Hampshire, Plymouth State was one of them. And I learned a lot about the different colleges but they never showed us how to pay. And we didn't know of any of the options that would be open to her and some kind of scholarship definitely would help her. But we would take out a home equity loan on our house.
Hillary detailed proposals to offer retirement savings plans for every American and unlock the doors to higher learning by providing generous tax credits to help all young people afford a college education. Read more about Hillary's middle class agenda here.
"As the next President of the United States, Hillary will lead this nation in a direction of hope, change and prosperity," said Assemblymember Juan Arambula (D-Fresno). "Senator Clinton is the most qualified candidate in the race having tackled such critical issues as healthcare, education, job creation and a strong defense. Hillary Clinton is a positive change for our country and most especially for the Central Valley. I am proud and honored to offer my strong endorsement for Senator Hillary Clinton. "
"Senator Clinton has a great understanding and insight on critical issues facing our nation as well as the Central Valley. Senator Clinton's efforts on the environment, health care, education, and the economy are important to our quality of life here in the Central Valley and Fresno," said Fresno City Councilmember Blong Xiong.
Here at home, during my time in the Senate, I have cherished the opportunity to work with my women colleagues in both Houses and on both sides of the aisle. Now we may not see eye to eye on everything, but we get together and we trade those very important bits of advice like what kind of shoes to wear on marble floors when you're on your feet all day. And when it comes to the issues that we can agree on -- whether it's afterschool funding or healthcare and education for women here in America or for women in Afghanistan-- we are a force to be reckoned with.
Now, some might say that their work is finished in America since women no longer face legal obstacles to education or employment or the right to vote. But we know that even though legal barriers have fallen away -- economic and attitudinal ones still remain. And that so long as there are gaps between our aspirations and our reality, their work and ours is not finished. That more perfect union still awaits.
We need to recognize the challenges that so many people face today. You know, the economy is much more difficult. The average American family has lost a thousand dollars in income in the last six years but the costs of everything else have gone up- health care, education, energy and gas. It's much tougher for young families to really pull together the time they need for each other.
She also laid out an agenda to help college students and young voters realize their full potential by improving access to higher education, creating new jobs, tackling global challenges like the environment and the spread of HIV/AIDS.
"I have been a big fan of Hillary's for a long time because she understands the issues that are important to me." said Christine Snively, a UNH graduate student who is expected to introduce Hillary at an event at the Durham campus. "She has strong plans to restore the Middle Class and provide universal healthcare to every American. Hillary also recognizes the importance of making college affordable and of promoting alternative means of education for kids who don't take the college route."

"She has strong plans to restore the Middle Class and provide universal healthcare to every American. Hillary also recognizes the importance of making college affordable and of promoting alternative means of education for kids who don't take the college route."
Hillary has demonstrated her commitment to the issues that matter most to America's youth. She believes they have the right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, pursue a higher education, purchase a home, enjoy a fulfilling career, afford childcare, and live in a country that holds the same stature in the world as America did when she was growing up. Recently, she introduced plans to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act and make college affordable.
Washington, DC -- Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on President Bush to reconsider immigration proposals reportedly under consideration by the Bush Administration that would dramatically scale back the existing family visa system. The proposal reportedly would place caps and waiting periods on the parents of U.S. citizens applying for green cards, force all applicants who have been waiting in a family visa backlog to start again and pay a $500 fee, and create a point system that would deny visas to family members based on their education and skill levels. In a letter to President Bush, Senator Clinton emphasized that this immigration proposal would not only fail to help immigrant families, but would dramatically worsen the situation for families of hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens and lawful immigrants throughout the country.
"Although some AAPIs have reached the pinnacle of higher education, I am fully aware that others in the AAPI community continue to remain behind. For this reason, I have been a strong advocate for making college affordable and accessible. As Senator, I fought to increase the federal Pell Grant, which today covers only a third of tuition at an average public college and co-sponsored the DREAM Act, which makes it possible for hardworking young people to receive in-state tuition at state colleges. I also led the passage of legislation that will bring more qualified teachers into the classrooms and more outstanding principals to lead our schools.
"I am honored to be joined by so many leaders that have dedicated their lives to advocating for better education for our children, access to health care, civil and voting rights and advancing economic opportunities not only for Latinos, but for all Americans," Clinton said. "With their support, we will continue taking our message of change across the country."

Rep. Clarke (Brooklyn, NY 11th CD) is in her first term in Congress after serving five years on the New York City Council representing Brooklyn. She was also the Chair of the Contracts Committee during her tenure in the Council. In Congress, Rep. Clarke serves on the Homeland Security, Education and Labor, and Small Business House Committees. Rep. Clark is dedicated to providing responsible governance for immigration reform, education, employment and economic development.
"These are times of challenge, but also of opportunity for Hispanics in America. To be able to face the challenges ranging from access to health care and quality education to comprehensive immigration reform and ending the war in Iraq, Hispanics must be at the table when decisions are made.
"The AAPI community has an opportunity to make a real difference in this presidential election, especially in California," said Soo. "Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to address the issues facing our community including improving education, providing all Americans with quality, affordable health care, and finally fixing our broken immigration system."
Expanding opportunity is at the core of the American dream. We believe that if we work hard and play by the rules, we can succeed and create better lives for ourselves and our children. Latinos understand and value the importance of opportunity - a good education system and good jobs.
But school readiness is just the beginning. We also need to do better by Hispanic children throughout the education pipeline so that they can realize their dreams and aspirations. That means raising achievement, closing the achievement gap, focusing on the drop out crisis and getting all Latino children to college. As President, Hillary Clinton will:
But expanding educational attainment will mean nothing if there aren't good jobs. And that's why Hillary Clinton has an economic agenda focused on creating good jobs. During the 1990s, the Latino middle class expanded. There are more than nine million Hispanics living in poverty today, including 4.2 million Hispanic children, but the typical Hispanic family has seen its real income fall nearly $1,000 since President Bush took office. As President, Hillary Clinton will:
During her participation in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's Presidential Forum, Hillary detailed some of the initiatives contained in the Agenda. It includes ideas to improve the quality of education we provide to Latino children, to provide more pathways to economic success, to offer quality health care that is affordable, to increase the supply of affordable housing, to support our veterans, to ensure environmental justice, and to craft comprehensive immigration reform.
In February of 1958, four months after Sputnik's launch, America launched DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. By July of that year, Congress passed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, creating NASA and ushering in the missions that would define the space race: Mercury and Gemini. In September 1958, President Eisenhower signed into law the National Defense Education Act to advance at every level our ability to compete and innovate: math and science education in primary and secondary schools, college loans, graduate fellowships, vocational training.
We still have a problem in women and minorities to enter science and engineering. And let's do a better job of replicating educational excellence in math and science from school to school. Congress recently passed into law the America Competes Act which contains two of my proposals. One would study promising practices in math and science education. We have to quit reinventing the wheel -- if something works in a school, especially where children come from disadvantaged backgrounds, to light their faces up, get them involved, let's replicate it. Let's work to do what we can to make sure that something happening in New York or Los Angeles is followed in Houston or Miami. [Applause]

"Many would like nothing more than to contribute to the only country they've ever known as home. But for these children, because of their immigration status, they are often effectively barred from pursuing a post-secondary education and reaching their full potential. Through no fault of their own, they are forced to live in the shadows and denied their chance at achieving their God given potential.
"There is a solution to this crisis, but sadly, the Senate today failed to act. The DREAM Act – which I have proudly cosponsored for several years – would help expand opportunities for our nation's immigrant children. For those students who have grown up in the United States, have demonstrated good moral character, and are pursuing a college education or have enlisted in the military, the DREAM Act will provide an opportunity to earn legal status in this country.
"There are many good reasons to enact the DREAM Act. In today's twenty-first century economy, where a post-secondary education is quickly becoming the minimum requirement for higher-earning jobs, we need to provide the children in our country with every opportunity to achieve academically, both for their benefit but also for the benefit of our society. The DREAM Act would also strengthen our nation's military readiness, allowing these well-qualified young men and women to serve their country with honor. But most importantly, the DREAM Act ensures that the promise of the American Dream becomes a reality for all our children.
Chang was appointed to his current post as City Councilmember At-Large in 1994 to fill a vacancy and was re-elected in 1997 and again in 2000 and 2004. Chang currently chairs the City Council's Life Enrichment Committee, co-chairs the Education Partnership Committee and serves on the Public Works Committee, the Community and Economic Development Committee, the Port Liaison Committee, and the Rules and Legislation Committee. His involvement with these committees reflects some of the key issues he has remained committed to through his career: education and youth, promoting Oakland's economy, responsible gun legislation, community development and support for the elderly. He has been selected by his fellow City Council members to hold the position of Vice Mayor for several terms, with the most recent term beginning in January 2007.
During the event, Senator Clinton discussed her agenda for a stronger America through job creation, quality education, health care for all and ending the war in Iraq. She outlined her plans to provide good jobs with good wages; encourage private sector investment and business growth in low-income areas; create more affordable housing in urban neighborhoods and ensure a strong federal-local partnership to fight crime.
That is only a partial list of the tasks ahead for the next president. There are also crises involving fair trade, product safety, public education, the Middle East, the Real ID program, the consequences of sub-prime mortgage lending and the troubling expansion of nuclear weapons technology. What's more, unknown challenges may lie just over the horizon. Addressing all these issues will take a strong and determined person.
The newspaper singled out her experience and positions on several key issues, including foreign policy and ending the war in Iraq, achieving universal health care, and improving education.
Too many Americans lack access to affordable health care. America's school districts are tethered to a questionable education policy that is No Child Left Behind. We refer to it as too-few-children-allowed-to-excel because it's a one-size-fits-all policy when school districts across the country are vastly different, from district to district, facing unique challenges that the bureaucrats in Washington will never see or completely understand.
She sees the federal government as a partner with states and local schools in ensuring quality education.
In its endorsement editorial the Kansas City Star wrote that Hillary 'is a woman of obvious intelligence with a strong commitment to reform on health care, taxes, energy, immigration, education and global warming."
In our view, however, Sen. Clinton would be the top choice for the Democratic nomination. She is a woman of obvious intelligence with a strong commitment to reform on health care, taxes, energy, immigration, education and global warming.
Throughout the years this newspaper has been coherent with its editorial principle which is based on the right of everyone to improve their quality of life which includes, exercising our right to vote, our right to have access to health care, education, culture and entertainment.
As I travel around the country, I know from what people tell me that a lot of really hard-working folks are concerned. You know, they're working as hard as they can, but they don't feel like they're getting ahead. They're not getting the kind of health care and educational opportunities that they want for themselves and their children.
And, together, we will come up with a 21st-century educational system for our children, where we look at each individual child and try to decide what we need to do to lift that little boy or girl to his or her God-given potential. That is the purpose of education, not test after test after test after test after test.
And we will do more to help communities like El Paso that need resources for health and education and law enforcement. And I want to work more with our neighbors and friends to the south to help those countries create more jobs for their own people, so that everyone would have a chance at a better life.
"I am proud of the longstanding relationship that I have had with the people of Hawaii and have great memories of my time in the state. Since my visit in 1993 when I met with leaders and health professionals to learn how Hawaii could be a model for the nation, we have made great progress," said Clinton. "Today, through our work, more than 15,000 children and over 5,000 of the state's National Guard members have access to health care. As President, I will work to create thousands of green jobs, lower energy costs, make high quality health care available in Hawaii's rural areas and improve Hawaii's education system so that all of Hawaii's families can participate in the American Dream."
In addition, she will address Hawaii's teacher shortage and honor the education funding promises that have been made to Hawaii by the federal government. The collective funding gap between what was promised and delivered in No Child Left Behind for Hawaii between 2002 and 2007 is $321.3 million. That funding could attract thousands of teachers to address the shortage and much more.
End The Unfunded Mandate of No Child Left Behind The No Child Left Behind Act is not working for Hawaii's children, parents, teachers, and school administrators. Hillary wants to end this one-size-fits-all approach to education reform and start fresh. She will put in its place an education law that rewards schools that are succeeding instead of punishing schools that are struggling, and she'll provide more flexibility so that school districts with very diverse populations, like those in Hawaii, will be able to meet the goals laid out for them. Hillary will also honor the funding promises that have been made to Hawaii by the federal government. The collective funding gap between what was promised and delivered in NCLB for Hawaii between 2002 and 2007 is $321.3 million. That funding could attract thousands of teachers to address Hawaii's teacher shortage, provide high-quality pre-K, and much more. As President, Hillary will:
"Latino families are concerned about our economy and the well-being of their families. Hillary Clinton has a plan to put our economy back on track, improve access to quality education for our nation's children and to support comprehensive immigration reform. She is the best choice for Rhode Island and our nation," said Mayor David Cicilline.
"Chris Bell has been a strong voice for Texans and I am so proud to have his support of my candidacy," Clinton said. "From the economy, to education, to health care, Congressman Bell knows it will take experience and strength to make change happen in the White House. I look forward to having his help in spreading our message across Texas."
Congressman Bell is a strong advocate for health care reform, public school education and a passionate supporter of stem cell research. He has long fought for issues important to Texans, including comprehensive immigration reform and improving transportation.
Expanding opportunity is at the core of the American dream. Hillary believes that anyone who works hard and plays by the rules can succeed and create better lives for themselves and their children. Latinos understand and value the importance of opportunity - a good education system and good jobs. That is why Hillary Clinton has an agenda that expands opportunity for Latinos, and ensures una vida mejor para todos.
Hillary's education agenda starts with closing the early achievement gap; she will help address it by ensuring every child in America enters school ready to learn. As President, Hillary Clinton will:
But school readiness is just the beginning. We also need to do better by Hispanic children throughout the education pipeline so that they can realize their dreams and aspirations. That means raising achievement, closing the achievement gap, focusing on the drop out crisis and getting all Latino children to college. As President, Hillary Clinton will:
After World War II, my father started a small business, saved up enough money to purchase a home. He, like so many veterans coming back from World War II, were anxious to get on with their lives. He moved us to a suburb where he paid taxes for better schools, and where our nation made unprecedented investments in public education.
The president could have responded to our health challenges by investing in public health here and around the world. The president could've said we need to be smarter about how we engage with the rest of the world so let us lead in trying to make education more universally available to the 77 million children who are shut out, including in countries like Pakistan where too often the young boys are then turned over for indoctrination to the Madrassas because there are no alternative. The president literally could have access to do anything, called on our patriotism and our unity. But he only asked us to draw on our wallets and go shopping.
"But we can only make our economy stronger with an educated workforce. While many AAPIs have succeeded in attaining higher education, I am fully aware that others in the AAPI community continue to struggle to reach these same achievements. For that reason I will continue to strongly advocate for making college affordable and accessible and propose universal pre-school education for all our nation's children.
Now, to help reshuffle the deck, people have to do their part. They have to, you know, step up and take education seriously. They have to be willing to work hard because nothing is given to you. My dad was a small businessman and when I say that he was a really small businessman, you know, just a few day workers from time to time. My mom, my brothers and I, but he understood hard work was the path forward in the United States. He made a good living for our family and I will forever be grateful for that. Because when families are strong, America is strong. And I am convinced having thought for families going all the way back to my years in law school and ever since, there is nothing more important.
Now in this campaign, I think we have to wage and win four big fights. One is to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. And that means we've got to be really focused on what is going to prepare young people and we have to start early. Education is the key. But education in the first years of life is essential. Because now we know that brain development really has formed by the time a child is three or four. So, we've got to do more to make sure every child has the best chance to do well in school, to get ahead, to charge his or her own future, to live up to his or her own God-given potential.
So that's why I support President Obama's proposal for free community college which at least get you started and I'd like to look to see how we get the debt under control and give people a chance to, you know, not be burdened by debt which makes it really hard for them to start a business or to continue their education.
So this is going to be a big part of, you know, my education policy as I go forward in the campaign because you're 100 percent right. Too many young people today feel like, you know, it's just out of their reach or they graduate with some much debt they feel like they are paralyzed. They don't know what to do. They can't buy a house, they can't get married, they can't start a business because the have so much in student debt.
But, you know, you also have a lot of people who don't have that much in assets and income. So it's all, you know, relative to what they can afford. So we have to do more on that. And I want to put in a big plug before we give you the last word about Rancho because I learned today that this school uses Title I funds to pay for the A.P. exam fee. This is, you know, this sounds a little archane but I want to emphasize how important this is because when you look at high school education, making it possible for more students to have access to advanced placement courses really ups the level of education.
And I want to say something else about it, when people talk to me about the need to improve our educations system, I agree, because I want every child to have the best possible education. But education starts at birth. Education starts when that little baby comes into the world. In fact we now know, because of brain research, that about 80% of the brain is actually developed by the age of 3 and 4. If we don't take care of our babies we are short changing them on their brain development and then when we get to kindergarten no matter how hard they try, no matter how much their mom says do your best, do your homework, no matter how hard their teacher works they're going to be at a disadvantage. That's wrong, it isn't right that a child like my grandchild will have all of these opportunities because we're reading and we're talking and we're singing but we're not working 17 hour days and we're not trying to get by on $5100 after the expenses are paid. So yea, we're going to make sure that Charlotte has every chance in the world but I want every baby, everyone your babies and every baby you take care of to have exactly the same chances.
As millions of Americans can personally attest, student debt and the high cost of college are holding too many people back. That's why President Obama acted to help millions of borrowers with direct student loans from the federal government by allowing them to cap their monthly payments at 10 percent of their income. And the Department of Education is currently changing its regulations to make a "pay as you earn" plan broadly available within the next year—which would benefit millions more. We need to do more to help students and their families afford higher education—not undo these important steps while the cost of college skyrockets.

Making college affordable isn't just a campaign promise for Hillary—she's been working on it since her days as first lady of Arkansas. She helped found the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, which has helped more than 38,000 people attend college. Then, as a U.S. senator, she introduced legislation to give students the option of income-based loan repayment. She also introduced a bill to make Pell Grants available year-round, so nontraditional students could afford to pursue their education during the summer months. And she co-sponsored legislation to help student borrowers refinance their loans.
"Planned Parenthood has issued its first-ever primary endorsement of Hillary because she's been fighting for women and families her entire life. In Arkansas, she launched the first rape crisis hotline in the state. In the Senate, she fought tirelessly for reproductive rights, access to birth control, and sex education. As secretary of state, women's health and women's rights were the centerpiece of her agenda. All that experience means that Hillary has the skills and the scars that no one else can match. She is the strongest, most qualified candidate for the office of president that I have ever encountered. But in an election, she'll only be as powerful as those who stand with her."
"Her commitment to promoting policies to develop alternative energy technologies and fighting global warming are only two of the many issues in which Hillary has shown her ability to lead. Senator Clinton also has a long record of working on issues that are important to women and to Latino families, such as education, healthcare and economic empowerment. I look forward to working to help elect Hillary the next president of the United States."
Mr. Congressman over there, are you in favor of clean energy and affordable college? Are you in favor of early childhood education and the way we're going to get it is to tax the two people in your district who make more than $5 million? Or are you going to deny that to the 350,000 people who live in your district?
"Congress must pass the federal Equality Act. That law would finally outlaw discrimination against LGBT people basically everywhere?—?in employment, housing, public education, public accommodations, access to federal funding and credit, and in the jury system."
She'll cut taxes for the middle class, raise the minimum wage, and ensure the wealthiest pay their fair share.
She'll invest in infrastructure and education. This woman really cares.
I've watched and followed her career, and saw her take hits.
Yet she still manages to stand here decades later as if it didn't bother her one bit!

  " The frustration over the economic recovery that benefits too few Americans, the shortcomings of health care reform and the high cost of college education is genuine. So are the concerns about global terrorism, personal security at home and the nation's relationships with old adversaries abroad. ... Clinton is clearly the best prepared to achieve results in each of those areas."

  " Clinton has a long list of sound policy proposals, from aiming for a cure for Alzheimer's to campaign finance reform, climate change, early education, higher education, the economy, gun violence, immigration, racial justice, Social Security, veterans, workforce skills and more."

  " In 1995, the year I was born, Hillary Clinton made a revolutionary speech, proclaiming "women's rights are human rights". I heard it many years later, but it has inspired me every day since then to keep reaching higher. Hillary is a role model and an icon, who I know has inspired thousands of women like myself. As someone growing up with health problems, quality health care is important to me. Hillary is the only candidate I trust to improve our health care system. Now I'm navigating my way through college (and soon law school, like Hillary!), and I believe wholeheartedly in her plan to improve student debt. Her policies on gun safety, reproductive rights, climate change, education, immigration, her economics initiatives, and so much more made the choice to support her easy. I am happy to fight every day to elect Hillary Clinton, because I know she will fight for not only me, but this entire nation."
"We will defend the Affordable Care Act and continue to improve it, by capping out-of-pocket costs, taking on runaway prescription drug prices, and continuing to expand enrollment. We'll invest in education, with universal pre-K and debt-free college tuition, so every child has the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. I will always stand with the CAPAC Leadership PAC in the fight to show the world what we know to be true: we are stronger together. And when families are strong–America is strong."
"Four years ago today, President Obama used his constitutional authority to change the lives of thousands of young people who call America home. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) has given DREAMers the freedom to provide for their families, further their educations, and live their lives without fear of being deported from the country they know and love. This policy is good for our economy–and it is true to our values as Americans. We are proud of our heritage as a nation of immigrants. We believe every young person deserves the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. We know we are stronger together.
Fifth, let's recommit ourselves to the idea that every young person in America who wants to should have the opportunity to attend college, and that a 21st-century education starts early in life and continues well into adulthood.
You know, a lot of people around the world are writing America off. They do believe our best days are behind us. I could not disagree more. I believe America can rebound from these last six years. I believe we can restore fairness and ensure that all share in our prosperity. I believe we can reduce the deficit and restore fiscal responsibility and give people the education and opportunities they need to fulfill their God-given potentials.
Instability and extremism fester in places where infrastructure, education, and opportunity are also lacking. I've introduced the Education for All Act to provide $10 billion over five years toward the goal of basic education for every boy and girl around the world. From Pakistan to Sudan, parents want their children to have an education, but too often governments fail in delivering that basic service or find themselves without the resources to do so even if they are willing. Education is a tool to combat HIV/AIDS, empower women, and certainly for economic development. And I believe all of that plays to our strengths.
You know, despite the professed attempts at military transformation, much more needs to be done. We do need to increase the size of the Army to address the myriad threats that we still face, even after we begin withdrawing from Iraq. We need to reform the Pentagon's acquisition system to rein in the costs of weapons systems and spending on outside contractors. And we need to find the right mix between legacy systems that our service members are currently using and newer programs that will allow us to keep our technological edge.Our experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan mean that we must not just learn but incorporate the lessons of asymmetric warfare and train and equip our forces accordingly.Finally, we need to re-evaluate the entire training and education that service members need in the 21st century.
That's why I have proposed providing family members the education and training they need to help their loved ones with TBI and giving them the option to become certified caretakers and paying them for providing this care for their own family members.
The original GI Bill of Rights was one of the VFW's signature accomplishments. It didn't just help a generation of veterans build their lives â€“ it helped a generation of Americans build a thriving middle class. So I take personal pride, tremendous personal pride in the fact that the VFW has endorsed my GI Bill of Rights. And I want to pay tribute to my House sponsor, young Congressman from Pennsylvania Patrick Murphy. I met Patrick Murphy when he was a Captain in the 82nd Airborne in Baghdad in 2003 when I was there on my first trip. That was still a time when we could get out of the green zone, we went to Sadr City, and we met with members of the 82nd, one of whom was this bright young Captain named Patrick Murphy. When he left the army he decided to continue his public service in another way. He ran for, and won, a seat in Congress. So when I was thinking about what kind of Bill of Rights, a GI Bill of Rights we needed for the twenty-first century, he was one of the first calls I made â€“ because he had lived it. And together, our bill provides educational opportunities â€“ from college, to trade and technical training, to certification and licensing programs. It expands opportunities for veterans to buy, build, repair and improve their homes. It creates a Veterans Micro-loaning Program to provide loans up to $100,000 at very low interest rates and without collateral, so that veterans can start their own small businesses. And I appreciate your support and we are going to get it done together.
Fourth, I want to transform the bureaucracy, we have a 20th century veterans' infrastructure and we need a 21st century system. I will do it by appointing a single, high-level experienced veteran, in the White House, reporting directly to me responsible for streamlining and coordinating all health care, educational and career programs for veterans. The reason I recommend this is because my last trip to Ft. Drum, I spoke to 50 of our 10th Mountain Division soldiers who had just came back from Afghanistan, all of whom had been wounded. The Department of Defense wasn't talking to the VA, the medical records at DOD didn't find them their way to the VA, and this made no sense to me at all. We need a single seamless system, and the way to get it done is to have someone in the White House reporting to the President, who will drive every single agency of this government to take care of every one of our veterans, the way they deserve to be taken care of.
That begins with ensuring that America does have the world's strongest and smartest military force. We've begun to change tactics in Iraq, and in some areas particularly in Al Anbar province it's working; we're just years too late changing our tactics. We can't ever let that happen again. We can't be fighting the last warâ€”we have to be preparing to fight the new war and this new war requires different tactics and strategies. We have to be prepared to maintain the best fighting force in the world. I proposed increasing the size of our army by 80,000 soldiers, balancing the legacy systems with newer programs to help us keep our technological edge, reevaluating the training and education programs that servicemembers need in the 21st century. And let's be sure that the American military does not fight terrorism alone. It is time that we demanded that our alliances, including NATO, are united with us in this fight and that their intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security systems are working together with ours. And let's not forget, that the War on Terror like the Cold War is fundamentally a battle over ideas and values.
So taken together, the pressures of stagnant wages; rising health, education, and energy costs; increased household debt; and a softening housing market are creating a trap door economy. Too many families are standing on that trap door, just one diagnosis, one pink slip, one missed mortgage payment away from falling through and losing everything they've worked for. They're bearing all of the risks of the global economy but reaping few of the rewards.
Think about Teddy Roosevelt busting the trusts and rooting out corruption. Franklin Roosevelt building the infrastructure that drove this century's economy. President Truman ensuring that American GIs had the tools they needed to seize the promise of a great and growing future. President Eisenhower supporting more science and math education. President Kennedy set our sights on the moon and President Johnson worked to end poverty and the insecurity that comes as we grow older.
We know that we've got to improve the skills and education of our workforce. But today, and I have to confess I was surprised, I asked to find out the statistic but even I was surprised. 75% of students at America's best public and private universities and colleges come from the top 25% of income in America. Think about that. So that leaves 25% for everybody else. Just 3% of the students come from the bottom 25% of income. It didn't used to be like this. We used to believe that if you worked hard and you were college material, you would go to college. We clearly need to make college accessible so that students from all different backgrounds have the chance to fulfill their God-given potential.
Hillary Clinton built on her long history of fighting for our veterans and announced new policies to ensure our country fulfills its obligations to those who have served and sacrificed for the nation. She announced that, as President, she will enact a GI Bill of Rights for the 21st century that will offer service members, veterans and their families with expanded education, housing and entrepreneurial benefits. In addition, as President, Hillary will ensure that all of the 1.8 million uninsured veterans in this country has access to quality, affordable health care and will establish a pilot program on homelessness prevention for veterans. The program will provide subsidies, eviction prevention, and one-time assistance for veterans who fall behind on their rent.
One of the first things I worked on was going door to door, trying to find out where missing children were. Missing not because somebody had kidnapped them but missing because they weren't in school. Back in the early 1970's you could look at census figures about the number of children who lived in a particular area. Then you could look at school enrollment figures and there were children who were in the area who weren't in school and nobody could figure out why. And I found out why. I found children who were blind, children who were deaf, children in wheelchairs, children with other kinds of disabilities. There was no place for them in a beautiful school like this. So I worked with many others to change the law, to make it possible for children with disabilities to get a public education and I was proud to be part of making change that helped millions and millions of Americans.
In Arkansas I worked to expand rural health care into some of the poorest places in the state. I worked to reform schools so if you were a poor child living in a really poor area of Arkansas you often would go to a school that didn't have physics, it didn't have advanced mathematics, or chemistry, it didn't have foreign languages. So no matter how talented you were, no matter how hard working you were willing to be, you would never be able to compete for a first class education. So we changed that. We changed the standards. We improved education and independent observers said it was one of the best reforms in the country. Because, you see, I knew that to make change you had to work with people, to raise teacher's salaries and to expand the curriculum, so thousands of Arkansas students now have an education that was denied to previous generations and I am proud that I was part of making those changes as well.
And we'll make a new beginning on education. We're going to provide early childhood education, something that Connie has worked on her entire professional life. We need to build stronger families. We need to have more early intervention. We need to help parents know what they need to do in order to help their own children. This is something I have worked on for decades. I brought a program to Arkansas, the Home Instruction for Preschool Youngsters program, that gave parents the tools they needed to help their own children. Because that's the best way for us to really make a difference in a child's life. And then we'll have a universal pre-kindergarten program that reaches those kids particularly who are disadvantaged to give them even more help and support. And we're going to end the unfunded mandate known as No Child Left Behind.
"Bob is a leading voice on the most critical issues facing our nation, from education to national security to health care," Clinton said. "I am deeply honored to have his support and counsel as we take our message of change across America."
After thoughtful deliberation, I am decidedly confident that Senator Hillary Clinton is the candidate best suited to be the Democratic Presidential Nominee and the next President of the United States. I have personally had a positive working relationship with Senator Clinton for a number of years. In her current position as United States Senator from New York, she has also been very supportive of Abyssinian Baptist Church's development work in Harlem. Thus, I have seen first-hand the wisdom, insight and concern she brings in her approach to community development, educational and developmental opportunities for youth, and economic revitalization, as well as tirelessly advocating for families, promoting health care reform, and fighting the global HIV/AIDS crisis. /p&gt;
On domestic policy, both candidates would turn the government onto roughly the same course - shifting resources to help low-income and middle-class Americans, and broadening health coverage dramatically. Mrs. Clinton also has good ideas about fixing the dysfunction in Mr. Bush's No Child Left Behind education program.
We will also lead in providing opportunity to the world's children. When 100 million children in the developing world don't attend school and 150 million more drop out before finishing the first grade – that is a recipe for poverty, instability and extremism. That's why I have introduced the bipartisan Education for All Act; $10 billion over five years for the goal of basic education for every boy and every girl around the world.
Senator Hillary Clinton: Well that's a great distinction, congratulations. So we came to a place that is already quite unique, here in the Y Bridge City, to talk about the future. We're joined by distinguished guests from across the state as well as the country; elected officials, leaders from labor and business and education, and some hard-working Ohioans who you'll hear from.
And the third thing is certainly education because education is the ultimate hope for our people and making sure we have a good, high-quality educational experience for our children from their youngest years through even graduate work and the adult worker up to the time of retirement. These are the three things that I think Ohio needs. I think they're the things that you as president will accomplish. If we can get that done, you become president and you do those three things for Ohio, we're going to say you were a pretty good president.
Lieutenant Governor David Patterson: I'm sorry, I'm just practicing. I just think that your ideas, just like what Governor Strickland is doing here in Ohio with the research and technology corridor on Route 115 in Columbus, trying to take our educational institutions like Ohio State and then use that to create new jobs. We do it in New York as well. We do it with medical and scientific research. The federal government has shut the door on medical and scientific research but also with green collar jobs. What you were talking about, that Germany is the world leader in solar power, they have no more sunlight than the United States. The greatest amount of wind power jobs in this country were created last year. They actually created as many jobs in the succeeding four years. I think Senator, President, whatever we can do to help you when you get to the White House is just the fact that the states are almost fighting among themselves and the jobs overseas. We need you to bring American jobs back to our shores and we need America to prosper in the way that can from the new technologies, what would be the new discoveries that can help us.
Do you know how many kids are failing school because they are fat? Do you know how many kids are not getting to school because they are fat? Do you know how many kids are dying, not just grownups but kids who are dying. I met a 14 year old the other day who was 100 lbs overweight with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, all of these terrible things and nobody seems to be doing anything about it because the kids are sitting in front of the computers. They are not really being motivated to get up. And the first ting that we cut out when we have to cut out our school systems is physical education. So education is extremely, extremely important.
Just think of how many potential Einstein's and Clintons and Jonas Salk's and Edison's that are out there that will never have an opportunity to go to school, to go to college. Therefore your plan on education excites me, makes me feel safe because when I think of President, excuse me, Senator Clinton, I think of the word safe because I know she is kind, good, smart, tough – she is brilliant, she is nurturing, she has a sympathetic part about her, an empathetic part about her – who will do for the country what she is going to do for my children and my grandchildren, hopefully my great grandchildren and my great-great grandchildren.
So education, preventative medicine, getting people to understand how to eat, how to be healthier; that's very important. Education is very important and I'll tell you one other thing. I will only feel safe if this woman becomes president of the United States of America. I feel that if God forbid, that phone, that red phone in the White House rings, I want her there to answer it.
Final topic is education and work force development. And Zanesville Mayor Butch Zwelling, the mayor of the Y-Bridge City, I know you are working hard to improve the skills and the training of workers here in your city and that you have had some success in bringing some new business even though you have lost some, it's been something you've worked really hard on. Could you talk about some of what you've learned about education workforce development?
Laura Meeks: Thank you Senator Clinton. Speaking on behalf of 1,200 community colleges in the nation, you are a friend of community colleges. We know that. As a matter of fact, you get it. You opened your comments by saying about higher education; we need to make sure it is accessible and affordable for all.
When I looked at her, she touched that catalog and it really became real to her. I look back on my life when I was twelve years old my father lost his business. He had a feed store, grinding feed for cattle and it burned. He became a truck driver and my mom washed dishes in a nursing home for twenty years. They made a good living but they taught me something important, and it's a lesson that all of us in higher education in Ohio understand. It's that you have to get an education to get a better job and everyday we know that. What makes it difficult for us is the high cost of tuition and in Ohio we do have a high cost. I am so honored to say that we have a governor, Governor Strickland, who froze tuition for the state of Ohio for two years and he did that at a great price.
When we talk about keeping the cost of tuition low, we need to make sure that we keep that low. You're right on, you get it. The other thing I'd like to say is that, we have a lot of work ethic, we have people with strong work ethic; we have a will to work. We have a fiber of higher education that can train people to work, what we need are the jobs, and you know what? We have them. We have the opportunity where we live we have smoke stacks, steel industries. We also have energy companies. We have first energy and also cardinal. AEP and they're cleaning; they're using resource to put in clears.
Those are some very good jobs. Youngstown State University and Jefferson Community College have a partnership, we've has 2 classes with 20 graduates; graduates in power technology who will go out and make at least $21 starting wages. We have really good jobs in the energy industry in Ohio. Engineering jobs and we have some hope of getting as coal liquefaction company that might come near us. I just want to say keep doing it, keep appreciating your higher education system in the United States.
Thank you for understanding the power of a community college. We have the will and we want to go to bed every night waking up in the morning knowing that someone in the White House shares our vision and our dream. That everyday in higher education we're trying to make the lives of people better for families in America by giving them a better chance for a better job. Thank you.
Senator Hillary Clinton: Oh great. That's so great. I just have to emphasize what you said about community colleges; they are so important for our economy. I was at Columbus State Community College a few days ago talking about the programs they have in order to train people for these new clean energy jobs and we can do this. We absolutely can do this. And I know, Gary, you've been working in some of the apprenticeship programs, Helmets to Hard Hats, a program that I've supported. So this needs to be joint effort; business, labor, government, education. All of us have to be on the same team, the American team. If we start once again playing on the American team, nobody can beat us. That's what I believe.
At the end of the day we have to decide what kinds of future we want. It doesn't happen by accident. What Laura was saying, you just don't stay at home and say I think I'll dream my way to a higher education, you've got to put on your boots, you've got to walk through the snow, you've got to deliver the application, you've got to attend the classes, you've got to be qualified.
Enact a GI Bill of Rights for the 21st Century. Hillary will enact a GI Bill of Rights for the 21st Century that will resurrect the spirit of the original 1944 GI Bill and offer service members, veterans and their families with expanded education, housing and entrepreneurial benefits. Her plan will guarantee equal access for all components of the Armed Forces -- Active, Guard and Reserve -- that have deployed overseas in support of a combat operation since September 11 or served two years of active duty since September 11. She will fund undergraduate education for service members, as well as education for specialized trade or technical training, and certification and licensing programs. She will make GI educational benefits transferable within families. She will expand the VA Home Loan Guaranty program to allow veterans to use low-interest, no-fee loans to purchase, build or improve a home valued up to $625,000. She will establish a Veterans Microloan Program to provide veterans with no-collateral, low-interest microloans of up to $100,000 for entrepreneurial ventures.

"Second, we can't look at this in a vacuum. Years of Republican obstruction at home have weakened U.S. competitiveness and made it harder for Americans who lose jobs and pay because of trade to get back on their feet. Republicans have blocked the investments that we need and that President Obama has proposed in infrastructure, education, clean energy, and innovation. They've refused to raise the minimum wage or defend workers' rights or adequately fund job training.
So far, we know that trying to do vet and understand the connections that a person or a family might have with somebody in the United States, you know, looking to see what organization, often a faith-based organization, will sponsor them and what they'll do to help them get education or a job, is by far the best way to sort out and to determine who should be included.
And the Republicans have blocked every effort to raise the minimum wage, better training, apprenticeship programs, make education more affordable. They have blocked every effort to try to make sure American workers were as prepared as possible to compete and win in the global economy.
And I particularly want a comprehensive health analysis of what's happened to these children. Lead is a poison. It destroys your brain. It interferes with your learning and your behavior. Whatever it takes for Michigan and the federal government to come together, through FEMA, through Health and Human Services, the EPA, whatever it takes, we now have to fix the problem and help these kids and especially their health and education development probably for years to come.
Mr. Congressman over there, are you in favor of clean energy and affordable college? Are you in favor of early childhood education and the way we're going to get it is to tax the two people in your district who make more than $5 million? Or are you going to deny that to the 350,000 people who live in your district?
