"In spending some time with her in person, I also found a mother and a grandmother who truly heard me and understood the depth of my loss. She knew all the statistics. But like so many, I've long since grown numb to the numbers. So instead, we talked about Trayvon and all the other families who have lost a loved one to gun violence. ... I agree with the president: We should only support leaders that fight for commonsense gun reforms. Clinton passes that test. Just as importantly, Clinton also wants to address larger, systemic problems."
"Our next president can't shy away from building on the progress of President Obama, which is why Hillary Clinton is the candidate that we need in the White House. She has the experience and right judgment to deliver results for families across the country. I've seen her deal with the issues that will confront the next president firsthand, and she has bold plans to address police brutality, fight for commonsense reforms to our gun laws, get incomes rising, and make college affordable. If we have a Republican president, they would tear down our progress on civil rights, health care, and curbing gun violence. It can't and won't happen under Hillary, who has spent her life taking on the toughest fights."
"There's a lot at stake in this year's election: college affordability, women's reproductive rights, gun violence prevention, LGBT equality. The only person I can imagine protecting America's future and putting us on a path to progress is Hillary Clinton. I know she is the right candidate for us. I know she's the right candidate for a young person like me. I know she's the right candidate for Asian Americans like us, and immigrants coming from near and far."
And there's a question, a question they should be asked: Why don't the Republican candidates want to do that?   You see, I have this old fashioned idea that we elect a President in part, in large part, to keep us safe, from terrorists, from gun violence, from whatever threatens our families and communities. And I'm not going to let the gun lobby or anyone else tell me that's not the right path for us to go down.
And then we know, don't we? Too many young African-Americans are dying in police incidents or because of gun violence.

We have 33,000 people a year dying from guns. I just cannot tolerate this any longer. I have met the families of those who have lost loved ones, who have lost the first graders in Sandy Hook, the bible study churchgoers in Charleston, the club-goers in Orlando, the moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado, people going about their lives being cut down and cut senselessly short. We have to take steps to reduce gun violence, and I know we can do that because the vast majority of Americans agree something must be done and a very big majority of gun owners agree as well.

We are not going to accept the status quo. What happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not be normal. People painted "vote Trump" on the side. And then they set it on fire. Who would do that to a house of worship? In America, that can never be acceptable. What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable -- little babies, toddlers, children drinking water that was poisoning them. And there are too many young African Americans who are dying either in police incidents or from random gun violence. You know their names: Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Sander Bland, Key Scott. So many. We can't accept that as normal either.

We're also going to take common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives. This has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent. Have you seen he's starting to wear a camo hat now? Really. We are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that we've got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them in the first place.

And there's a question, a question they should be asked: Why don't the Republican candidates want to do that?   You see, I have this old fashioned idea that we elect a President in part, in large part, to keep us safe, from terrorists, from gun violence, from whatever threatens our families and communities. And I'm not going to let the gun lobby or anyone else tell me that's not the right path for us to go down.
In 2016, we won't just choose our next president. America will choose a direction for our country on issues from gun violence prevention to women's rights to building an economy that helps the middle class get ahead—and stay ahead.
And we've got to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that has taken too many, too many lives in our country. Again, I think we can come together. A very long majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners believe in comprehensive background checks. They believe in the Second Amendment, as I do. They believe in the right of individuals to have guns, as I do. But they believe, along with me, that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people, and make it so easy to get them.
"Now, there's been a lot of talk about yes or no answers to complex questions. But most people don't know that for legislators who don't want to take a stand, there's a third way to vote. Not yes, not no, but "present" - which is kind of like voting "maybe." Well, in the Illinois State Senate, on issue after issue, my opponent voted "present," instead of yes or no. Seven of those votes were on a woman's right to choose. Two of those votes were on measures to protect families from gun violence - one of which was a measure about firing guns on or near school grounds.
The number of American lives lost to gun violence is more than three times the rate as the next developed country. We need to act.
That's the number of Americans who died from gun violence in a single year. No other developed country loses as many people to gun violence each year as we do.
The number of American lives lost to gun violence is more than three times the rate as the next country on the list. If that's shocking to you, it should be. But we need to do more than be shocked. We need to act.
Here's how Hillary will take on the epidemic of gun violence—with or without Congress's help.
This deadly problem is made worse because gun manufacturers and dealers have some powerful friends. The NRA and their Republican allies have helped grant them unique legal protection—which means that in some cases, victims of gun violence can't hold them accountable for violence caused by their products. And the NRA has gone out of their way to ensure the people responsible for regulating gun dealers can't do their jobs.
And as a result, American women are at a significantly greater risk of losing their lives to gun violence than women in any other high-income country.
With one group estimating more than 10,000 already killed by gun violence this year alone, it's time to demand more than thoughts and prayers from our elected officials. That's why Hillary's plan lays out concrete steps to make sure guns don't fall into the wrong hands while respecting the rights of responsible gun owners.
Hillary speaks on gun violence in Muscatine: "This is not 'stuff that happens.' We let it happen. We lose between 88 and 92 Americans a day from gun violence—homicides, suicides and accidents—and we have to act."

  .@people is right, we can't give up. It's time to act on gun violence. https://t.co/YvHxXm9hNm— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 10, 2015

4. The New York Daily News hails Hillary's gun violence prevention plan "an act of political courage."
Thoughts and prayers aren't enough. We need to act on gun violence.
2. Take notice: Hillary?"will not be silenced" on gun violence.?
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of more than 50 African-American mayors across the country," said Hillary Clinton. "Mayors are on the front lines of many of our country's toughest battles. They're fighting to create jobs, rebuild our infrastructure, stop gun violence, and eliminate the inequities that tear communities apart. From the biggest cities to the smallest towns, what happens at the local level often leads to national change. Mayors make that happen. As president, I'll always be a friend to America's mayors. I'll solicit their ideas and expertise at every step. And I'm proud to stand with them today, because mayors are critical to growing our economy and strengthening our country, one community at a time."
When this campaign first launched, Hillary said she was going to make sure her campaign addressed those issues that aren't making headlines but are keeping families up at night. She is working to close the school-to-prison pipeline, end the era of mass incarceration, confront institutional racism, and fight to prevent gun violence.
"I'm honored to receive the support of more than 85 mayors across the country today—because mayors know how to get things done," said Hillary Clinton. "As Senator, I worked with mayors from across New York who were committed to finding creative ways to help families get ahead and stay ahead. As President, I will fight alongside mayors to rebuild and modernize our infrastructure, get middle class incomes rising, and address the epidemic of gun violence."
5. Hillary continues to speak out about gun violence: "This is a danger, a threat, everywhere in our country."
The mothers of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Dontre Hamilton, Eric Garner, Frankie Valencia, Jordan Davis, Sandra Bland, Hadiya Pendleton, Terrell Bosley, and Blair Holt met with Hillary to discuss gun violence prevention and issues that affect their communities. While Hillary was meeting with the mothers, a 9 year old was killed by a stray bullet just across town, underscoring the urgency of addressing gun violence.
Since the last Democratic debate—a mere 32 days ago—nearly 3,000 people have died from gun violence in the United States.
Hillary made her voice loud and clear at tonight's debate: It's time to act. And she has a plan to prevent gun violence.
And there's a question, a question they should be asked: Why don't the Republican candidates want to do that?   You see, I have this old fashioned idea that we elect a President in part, in large part, to keep us safe, from terrorists, from gun violence, from whatever threatens our families and communities. And I'm not going to let the gun lobby or anyone else tell me that's not the right path for us to go down.
Their insistence on calling themselves "pro-life" while refusing to take action to prevent gun violence: 
In 2016, we won't just choose our next president. America will choose a direction for our country on issues from gun violence prevention to women's rights to building an economy that helps the middle class get ahead—and stay ahead.
President Obama just made an emotional call to stop gun violence in America—and backed it up by announcing executive actions intended to curb the epidemic of violence that's taking more than 33,000 American lives every year.
These are important steps that will respect the Second Amendment while working to protect our families and communities from gun violence. But there's more we have to do—and it's going to require all of us to stand up and say, "Enough."
And that means voting. If you want to defend President Obama's actions to help prevent gun violence from taking more American lives, you have to vote in this election—because the Republicans running for president would rip away these executive actions and the progress we've made.

  Thank you, @POTUS, for taking a crucial step forward on gun violence. Our next president has to build on that progress—not rip it away. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 5, 2016

In 2015, there were more days with a mass shooting than without a mass shooting. But even as Americans mourned one heartbreaking shooting after another, Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail refused to take meaningful action to prevent gun violence.?
It's time for people across the country—including responsible gun owners—to come together and stand up to the gun lobby and anyone who continues to stand in the way of commonsense gun violence prevention measures like background checks.?

  " The vast majority of Americans support common sense steps to reduce and prevent gun violence. ... 92 percent of Americans support these measures, 83 percent of gun owners support them. ... I know there are some who don't believe we should be talking about this issue, or wish to somehow push it into the background. Well I will not be silenced. I will continue to talk about what we as a nation must do to protect ourselves."
Let's make 2016 be the year we take on gun violence once and for all.?
And it's a difference that Democratic voters in our primary can take into account. Who is going to really stand up to the gun lobby, try to deal with the scourge of gun violence that takes 90 people's lives a day? I'm pretty clear on what I will do. And I support and will work hard to implement what the president has been advocating.
Hillary Clinton released the following statement in response to receiving the endorsement of Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly:"As an admirer of their courage in the face of incredible odds, their service to the country that they love, and their commitment to ending the epidemic of gun violence, I am humbled to receive the endorsement of these American heroes.
"Gabby and Mark know too well what is at stake in this debate and in this election. Three Americans die every hour we don't act. 90 die every day. 33,000 die every year. We cannot accept this as normal. Gabby and Mark certainly do not. Since being shot and partially paralyzed five year ago, Gabby has worked tirelessly for progress—founding Americans for Responsible Solutions, traveling across the country to tell her story and promote commonsense gun safety laws, launching a bipartisan coalition in New Hampshire to prevent gun violence, and fighting in support of President Obama's recent executive actions. Through it all, Mark has been by her side—as her partner, her champion, and her biggest fan. I am honored to join them in their fight for common sense gun reform. 
In fact, a lot of the people running for president seem downright terrified to even have a rational conversation about the problem of gun violence in America. We've listened closely to all of them, and we've looked at all of their records.Only one candidate for president has the determination and toughness to stand up to the corporate gun lobby—and the record to prove it. That candidate is Hillary Clinton.
At tonight's State of the Union address, one chair will remain empty in honor of the victims of gun violence who no longer have a voice. My daughter, Ana Grace M?rquez-Greene, is one of them.
We are now at a crossroads in America—a tipping point on gun violence. And we need a candidate that will balance Second Amendment protection with the protection of human life. We need a rational, forward-moving conversation to address this issue. And we must not get stuck in partisan rhetoric.
President Obama recently announced that he's going to take executive action to strengthen background checks and make it harder for dealers to sell guns to criminals. That's a commonsense step. And with more than 33,000 deaths from gun violence each year, it's a badly needed one.
The answers on gun violence at the Republican debate reached an all-time low.
But instead of debating how to close the loophole that let the Charleston shooter legally purchase a gun—or any other commonsense steps to prevent further gun violence—the candidates on stage spent their time assuring the gun lobby that they'll have nothing to worry about with a Republican in the White House.
All five of these Republican candidates managed to send one clear message: Not only will they not lift a finger to take on the deadly epidemic of gun violence in this country—but they'll stand on the side of the NRA.
We can't afford to send them to the White House. There's only one candidate in this race who's going to stand up to the gun lobby and take real action to to prevent gun violence in America—and that's Hillary Clinton.
So I want to see movement against the gun lobby, because we cannot continue to lose 90 people a day, 33,000 a year, to gun violence. And I welcome Senator Sanders moving on one of the issues he was wrong on. I hope he will continue to move.
There's good reason for that: As senator, Hillary co-sponsored and voted for legislation to close the gun show loophole by requiring criminal background checks on all transactions taking place at events that sell firearms. Unlike Bernie Sanders, she voted against the dangerous immunity protections Congress provided gun dealers and manufacturers that prevent victims of gun violence from holding the gun industry accountable. And she co-sponsored and voted for legislation to extend and reinstate the assault weapons ban. Hillary has always stood up to the gun lobby—and that won't change as president.
"In spending some time with her in person, I also found a mother and a grandmother who truly heard me and understood the depth of my loss. She knew all the statistics. But like so many, I've long since grown numb to the numbers. So instead, we talked about Trayvon and all the other families who have lost a loved one to gun violence. ... I agree with the president: We should only support leaders that fight for commonsense gun reforms. Clinton passes that test. Just as importantly, Clinton also wants to address larger, systemic problems."
"Our next president can't shy away from building on the progress of President Obama, which is why Hillary Clinton is the candidate that we need in the White House. She has the experience and right judgment to deliver results for families across the country. I've seen her deal with the issues that will confront the next president firsthand, and she has bold plans to address police brutality, fight for commonsense reforms to our gun laws, get incomes rising, and make college affordable. If we have a Republican president, they would tear down our progress on civil rights, health care, and curbing gun violence. It can't and won't happen under Hillary, who has spent her life taking on the toughest fights."
"There's a lot at stake in this year's election: college affordability, women's reproductive rights, gun violence prevention, LGBT equality. The only person I can imagine protecting America's future and putting us on a path to progress is Hillary Clinton. I know she is the right candidate for us. I know she's the right candidate for a young person like me. I know she's the right candidate for Asian Americans like us, and immigrants coming from near and far."

  " This epidemic of gun violence knows no boundaries, knows no limits of any kind. And when this happens, people are quick to say that they offer their thoughts and prayers. That's not enough. How many people have to die before we actually act, before we come together as a nation?"-Hillary Clinton

We repeated those words when we marched for justice for my son—justice we're still waiting on.?Along with too many others, Eric's death has forced our country to confront the effects of police brutality. We've got to do something about the violence in our communities—especially gun violence—and the racial and economic injustice that's connected to it.?
"I like to keep my friends interested and informed," says Patrick. "They know I'm involved in the campaign so they ask me about issues." They've talked about gun violence prevention, equality, and—unsurprisingly for a group of high school students—college affordability.
We are a smart—we are a smart people. We can do this. And what I don't understand is how when we know we have, on average, 90 people a day dying from gun violence, 33,000 people a year, we cannot figure out how to protect people, protect first-graders going to school, people going to a movie theater, churchgoers going to Bible study. We can do this. We can't stop every murder or every suicide or every tragic, avoidable accident, but we can stop a lot of them without infringing on anybody's rights.
And of course, some topics have come into even sharper focus over the past few months: the threat of global terror, the need to take action on gun violence, attacks on reproductive health and rights, the epidemic of violence facing the transgender community, the need to take on systemic racism and stand up to bullies, the crisis in Flint. Everywhere I've been, I've learned more about the concerns that keep families up at night—and what we need to do to solve them.
And on one heartbreaking day in Chicago, I sat down with a group of mothers who belong to a club that no parent ever wants to join: All have suffered the loss of a child to gun violence, some at the hands of police, others at the hands of gangs, random shootings, or other senseless violence that stalks too many of our young men and women. As they handed me pictures of their beloved children, they talked about turning their grief into national action that could spare other families the pain they've endured. After I left, I learned that as we spoke, a 9-year-old boy was shot and killed just miles away.
Gabby and Mark have made it their mission to stand up to the gun lobby and bring together Americans who support commonsense gun reforms. And right now, they're logging hours (and miles) on the campaign trail, helping to elect Hillary Clinton—the only candidate in this election who has the courage and commitment to confront the epidemic of gun violence in America and deliver real solutions.
More than 33,000 Americans were killed by gun violence last year alone—and a lot of people are throwing up their hands at the idea that anything will be done. What can our next president do that will make a difference? What is it actually going to take to convince Congress that we need commonsense gun legislation? And what can the rest of us do?
Unfortunately, Congress remains in the gun lobby's grip. So if Congress won't act to reduce gun violence, then we can work to have a different Congress.
"One of the first things that got my attention was Mrs. Clinton's stance on gun control," Denise says. "She understands that there's no reason for things like this to happen, and she wants to stop gun violence from taking so many people away."
The stakes in this election couldn't be higher. African Americans can't wait for solutions—they need results now. We need a President who can stand up to the Republicans and win. I'll take on the gun lobby to address the epidemic of gun violence. I'll take on the Republicans who are disenfranchising voters and rolling back voting rights. And I pledge a new and comprehensive commitment to equity and opportunity for communities of color. That means reforming our criminal justice system and rebuilding the bonds of trust between our communities and our law enforcement officials. But it also means making major new investments to create jobs, to make it easier to start and grow a small business, to end redlining in housing, and to build reliable public transit systems.
During the ride to our first stop of the day, Vivica and I discussed the reasons she's hitting the trail for Hillary. She talked about how important it is for us to protect all of the progress President Obama has made, especially with the Affordable Care Act and the president's work to reduce gun violence—because these issues disproportionately affect the African American community. She also shared how much she loves Hillary's New College Compact, which allocates $25 billion specifically for supporting HBCUs.
Under a law passed by a Republican-controlled Congress in 2005, victims of gun violence cannot legally hold irresponsible gun dealers or manufacturers accountable in most cases where their actions endanger Americans.
Ending the gun industry's legal immunity is an important step in tackling the epidemic of gun violence in this country.
In addition to saving lives on the operating table, Joe is a passionate advocate for gun violence prevention.
She explained: "These five women have lost children to police actions and to random senseless gun violence, and there's no doubt that in each case ... there is a racial component to it."
Sybrina: She showed us support and concern about what we were going through. No one stepped out of the political arena to do that. None of the candidates reached out to us. When they had their presidential debates, no one spoke about Black Lives Matter. No one spoke about senseless gun violence and how many African Americans were being killed and how no one was being held accountable for it. She supported us before we even supported her.
Well, I guess you can call me an unwilling participant. I don't think any of the mothers that I come to the table with want to be on that side of the table. I would not have signed up for this, I would not have trained for this. This is something that happens in your life and you feel like, "I have to do something about it. I can't just continue to be broken. I must do my part." And so this is me doing my part, not only for my son who's in heaven but for my son who's here on earth, too. I'll always have two boys. But I will continue to do the work to try to fight against senseless gun violence. I will try to do what I can, and I'm dedicated to this fight. I can't help Trayvon at this time. But there are other Trayvon Martins who I can help. And working with these mothers is one way I can do that.
It was very powerful. There was just this sense of awe, because I've been watching the cases on television, and I've been watching the women, and I've been listening to their stories and listening to the news. But to actually be in the same company of women who have been so morally injured by the same gun violence, the same implicit bias, that was just ... I looked at Cleo Pendleton, and I said to her, "You know what? I'm so glad we're together, but it's just so painful why we have to be at this meeting with Secretary Clinton. We shouldn't have to be here for these reasons." But it was empowering, because during that meeting Secretary Clinton told us, "I need you, the mothers, to mobilize and move forward in this movement." And before that, nobody else had really given us permission to really begin to challenge those things that we've suffered. We'd just taken permission, and decided ourselves to do it. But to have someone of the stature of Secretary Clinton back us up, and support us, and ask us to help champion as well, and to know that she's championing for us and our communities, that was huge. It was monumental to me.
There were 12 of us mothers in that meeting. Hillary asked each of us to share our stories, and everyone's child had died of gun violence—except for my child. So when it became my turn, she said, before I even spoke, "Well I know, Ms. Carr, your son didn't die from gun violence." I said, "You're right, he was choked to death." She said, "There's something we have to do about that, too." She took that into consideration, that no matter how your son died, it was still violence. And this is what we need our officials to recognize—our hurt and our pain, no matter how it came. It was really impressive to me because she was clearly concerned about my situation.
My home state of Mississippi has the second highest gun murder rate in the nation—nearly double the national average. Hillary Clinton has a plan to address gun violence with solutions that can actually be achieved. Gun violence is plaguing this country and robs us of 33,000 people every year. It is no coincidence that Mississippi has some of the country's most lenient firearms laws. Hillary Clinton is the candidate that stands up to the NRA.

  " Clinton has a long list of sound policy proposals, from aiming for a cure for Alzheimer's to campaign finance reform, climate change, early education, higher education, the economy, gun violence, immigration, racial justice, Social Security, veterans, workforce skills and more."
Last year, Hillary Clinton met with mothers who have lost their children to gun violence, police, and racially charged incidents.
The Court?"made same-sex marriage legal nationwide, preserved the Affordable Care Act—not once, but twice—and ensured equal access to education for women," Hillary said. However, it also "cut the heart out of the Voting Rights Act. It overturned commonsense laws addressing gun violence."?
Following the endorsement of Everytown for Gun Safety, including Moms Demand Action, an organization fighting for commonsense reforms to prevent gun violence, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"As a mother and a grandmother, I know nothing is more important than keeping our children safe. And I am honored to receive the endorsement of Everytown for Gun Safety, including Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. They are fighting every day for commonsense gun safety measures and to end the epidemic of gun violence.
"The gun lobby may be the most powerful lobby in Washington, but I believe that the American people are more powerful still. We are stronger together. We will not be intimidated. We will not back down. And as long as children anywhere are being killed by gun violence, we will keep fighting—because their lives are precious, and they deserve a president who stands up for them."
You know, for decades people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch. But I ask you, how can we just stand by and do nothing? You heard, you saw family members of people killed by gun violence, on this stage. You heard, you saw family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals.
"To strengthen our democracy, we need to get secret, unaccountable money out of our politics and get the voices of Americans back in. Every Voice is leading that fight. They uncover how special interests interfere with our democracy and block progress on critical issues like addressing climate change, preventing gun violence, and raising the minimum wage. And they have smart, concrete ideas on how to change our broken campaign finance system.
And we've got to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that has taken too many, too many lives in our country. Again, I think we can come together. A very long majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners believe in comprehensive background checks. They believe in the Second Amendment, as I do. They believe in the right of individuals to have guns, as I do. But they believe, along with me, that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people, and make it so easy to get them.
That starts with being honest. Being unafraid to face the facts. Face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped, searched by police, charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing. We need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses. We need to make sure our police officers are trained in de-escalating tense situations. We need to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education. And yes we have got to fight for common sense reforms to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our communities.
Now, there are some out there who see this as a moment to command the flames of resentment and division. Who want to exploit people's fears, even though it means tearing our nation even further apart. They say that all of our problems will be solved simply by more 'law and order.' As if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesn't exist. Now, of course we need safe neighborhoods, no one is against that. Of course, we need communities that are free from the epidemic of gun violence, of course we need that. But we also need justice and dignity and equality, and we can have both. This is not an either-or question for America.
And we're also going to protect our children from gun violence. We are not going to tolerate the kind of gun violence epidemic that has swept this country and results in the deaths of 33,000 people a year. We can come together to meet our challenges, no matter what they are.
You know, as Gabby says every day when she goes out, fight, fight, fight. And fight she does. She fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries and we do it together – to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children, our fellow men and women, our country. And Gabby and Mark know something very important: there is a big majority of Americans, including a majority of gun owners, to stand behind and achieve commonsense gun safety measures. And I am looking forward to working with them as their partner.
And think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America. As Gabby knows so well, 33,000 Americans a year are killed guns. Thousands more are injured. It's an average of 90 people a day dying. Here in Ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes. We have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters, little children killed in their classrooms, clubgoers massacred in Orlando, nine faithful people murdered at Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina. And we've seen far too many young African American men and women killed by gun violence, which is now the leading cause of death for young black men. And when we think about that, we think of Dontre Hamilton or Jordan Davis or Trayvon Martin and others. I've had the great honor of getting to know their mothers, who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement.
But here's what I want to say. If anything else in our country were killing as many people, people of good faith, people who believe, like we do, in the Second Amendment, people who own guns, people who go hunting, people who are collectors, we would say, hey, wait a minute. This can't go on. We need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole. And we know here in Ohio a majority of gun owners support these common-sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the Second Amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time. And we need to keep guns out of the hands suspected terrorists. If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun, period.
And then we know, don't we? Too many young African-Americans are dying in police incidents or because of gun violence.

We have 33,000 people a year dying from guns. I just cannot tolerate this any longer. I have met the families of those who have lost loved ones, who have lost the first graders in Sandy Hook, the bible study churchgoers in Charleston, the club-goers in Orlando, the moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado, people going about their lives being cut down and cut senselessly short. We have to take steps to reduce gun violence, and I know we can do that because the vast majority of Americans agree something must be done and a very big majority of gun owners agree as well.

We are not going to accept the status quo. What happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not be normal. People painted "vote Trump" on the side. And then they set it on fire. Who would do that to a house of worship? In America, that can never be acceptable. What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable -- little babies, toddlers, children drinking water that was poisoning them. And there are too many young African Americans who are dying either in police incidents or from random gun violence. You know their names: Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Sander Bland, Key Scott. So many. We can't accept that as normal either.

We're also going to take common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives. This has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent. Have you seen he's starting to wear a camo hat now? Really. We are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that we've got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them in the first place.

"Now, there's been a lot of talk about yes or no answers to complex questions. But most people don't know that for legislators who don't want to take a stand, there's a third way to vote. Not yes, not no, but "present" - which is kind of like voting "maybe." Well, in the Illinois State Senate, on issue after issue, my opponent voted "present," instead of yes or no. Seven of those votes were on a woman's right to choose. Two of those votes were on measures to protect families from gun violence - one of which was a measure about firing guns on or near school grounds.
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of more than 50 African-American mayors across the country," said Hillary Clinton. "Mayors are on the front lines of many of our country's toughest battles. They're fighting to create jobs, rebuild our infrastructure, stop gun violence, and eliminate the inequities that tear communities apart. From the biggest cities to the smallest towns, what happens at the local level often leads to national change. Mayors make that happen. As president, I'll always be a friend to America's mayors. I'll solicit their ideas and expertise at every step. And I'm proud to stand with them today, because mayors are critical to growing our economy and strengthening our country, one community at a time."
In 2016, we won't just choose our next president. America will choose a direction for our country on issues from gun violence prevention to women's rights to building an economy that helps the middle class get ahead—and stay ahead.
President Obama recently announced that he's going to take executive action to strengthen background checks and make it harder for dealers to sell guns to criminals. That's a commonsense step. And with more than 33,000 deaths from gun violence each year, it's a badly needed one.
There's good reason for that: As senator, Hillary co-sponsored and voted for legislation to close the gun show loophole by requiring criminal background checks on all transactions taking place at events that sell firearms. Unlike Bernie Sanders, she voted against the dangerous immunity protections Congress provided gun dealers and manufacturers that prevent victims of gun violence from holding the gun industry accountable. And she co-sponsored and voted for legislation to extend and reinstate the assault weapons ban. Hillary has always stood up to the gun lobby—and that won't change as president.
"In spending some time with her in person, I also found a mother and a grandmother who truly heard me and understood the depth of my loss. She knew all the statistics. But like so many, I've long since grown numb to the numbers. So instead, we talked about Trayvon and all the other families who have lost a loved one to gun violence. ... I agree with the president: We should only support leaders that fight for commonsense gun reforms. Clinton passes that test. Just as importantly, Clinton also wants to address larger, systemic problems."
"Our next president can't shy away from building on the progress of President Obama, which is why Hillary Clinton is the candidate that we need in the White House. She has the experience and right judgment to deliver results for families across the country. I've seen her deal with the issues that will confront the next president firsthand, and she has bold plans to address police brutality, fight for commonsense reforms to our gun laws, get incomes rising, and make college affordable. If we have a Republican president, they would tear down our progress on civil rights, health care, and curbing gun violence. It can't and won't happen under Hillary, who has spent her life taking on the toughest fights."
"There's a lot at stake in this year's election: college affordability, women's reproductive rights, gun violence prevention, LGBT equality. The only person I can imagine protecting America's future and putting us on a path to progress is Hillary Clinton. I know she is the right candidate for us. I know she's the right candidate for a young person like me. I know she's the right candidate for Asian Americans like us, and immigrants coming from near and far."
We are a smart—we are a smart people. We can do this. And what I don't understand is how when we know we have, on average, 90 people a day dying from gun violence, 33,000 people a year, we cannot figure out how to protect people, protect first-graders going to school, people going to a movie theater, churchgoers going to Bible study. We can do this. We can't stop every murder or every suicide or every tragic, avoidable accident, but we can stop a lot of them without infringing on anybody's rights.

  " Clinton has a long list of sound policy proposals, from aiming for a cure for Alzheimer's to campaign finance reform, climate change, early education, higher education, the economy, gun violence, immigration, racial justice, Social Security, veterans, workforce skills and more."
And there's a question, a question they should be asked: Why don't the Republican candidates want to do that?   You see, I have this old fashioned idea that we elect a President in part, in large part, to keep us safe, from terrorists, from gun violence, from whatever threatens our families and communities. And I'm not going to let the gun lobby or anyone else tell me that's not the right path for us to go down.
In 2016, we won't just choose our next president. America will choose a direction for our country on issues from gun violence prevention to women's rights to building an economy that helps the middle class get ahead—and stay ahead.

And of course, some topics have come into even sharper focus over the past few months: the threat of global terror, the need to take action on gun violence, attacks on reproductive health and rights, the epidemic of violence facing the transgender community, the need to take on systemic racism and stand up to bullies, the crisis in Flint. Everywhere I've been, I've learned more about the concerns that keep families up at night—and what we need to do to solve them.
And on one heartbreaking day in Chicago, I sat down with a group of mothers who belong to a club that no parent ever wants to join: All have suffered the loss of a child to gun violence, some at the hands of police, others at the hands of gangs, random shootings, or other senseless violence that stalks too many of our young men and women. As they handed me pictures of their beloved children, they talked about turning their grief into national action that could spare other families the pain they've endured. After I left, I learned that as we spoke, a 9-year-old boy was shot and killed just miles away.
Gabby and Mark have made it their mission to stand up to the gun lobby and bring together Americans who support commonsense gun reforms. And right now, they're logging hours (and miles) on the campaign trail, helping to elect Hillary Clinton—the only candidate in this election who has the courage and commitment to confront the epidemic of gun violence in America and deliver real solutions.
More than 33,000 Americans were killed by gun violence last year alone—and a lot of people are throwing up their hands at the idea that anything will be done. What can our next president do that will make a difference? What is it actually going to take to convince Congress that we need commonsense gun legislation? And what can the rest of us do?
Unfortunately, Congress remains in the gun lobby's grip. So if Congress won't act to reduce gun violence, then we can work to have a different Congress.
