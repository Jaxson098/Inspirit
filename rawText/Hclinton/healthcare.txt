Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY) introduced Senate legislation that will raise awareness about the availability of emergency contraception also known as Plan B or the "morning-after" pill. The bill authorizes an education campaign to better inform women and healthcare providers of emergency contraception. Representative Louise Slaughter (D-NY) has already introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.
"Her commitment to promoting policies to develop alternative energy technologies and fighting global warming are only two of the many issues in which Hillary has shown her ability to lead. Senator Clinton also has a long record of working on issues that are important to women and to Latino families, such as education, healthcare and economic empowerment. I look forward to working to help elect Hillary the next president of the United States."
Eighth, let's revitalize the health care system in this city. Reopen hospitals, and let's rebuild charity hospitals, and make it simple for healthcare patients. We need to address the growing mental health crisis in the city and the area. Let's promote smart development, clean efficient energy use, "green": buildings and so much else, so New Orleans is sustainable.
"Hillary Clinton has devoted her life to helping others," Dinkins said. "From healthcare to education to caring for our veterans, she has been a champion for the millions of Americans who have been invisible to this administration. Her depth of experience and her strength of character make her uniquely suited to be President."
"Hillary Clinton has answers for the questions on how to revitalize our urban communities. Her approach to handling public safety, youth violence and crime is timely. She is relevant because she will implement a comprehensive healthcare, employment and economic development plan. Because of her experience, she can extend and expand upon both Bill Clinton's and Lyndon Johnson's initiatives," said Paul Cobb, Bay Area community leader and publisher of the Oakland Post.
Throughout her career, Hillary Clinton has worked to protect civil rights and expand opportunities for African Americans. As President, Hillary Clinton will work to increase opportunities for African Americans - by improving our schools and our healthcare system, expanding access to capital, putting home ownership back in reach, cracking down on predatory lenders targeting African American communities, and making a national commitment to support young men of color who have fallen off track. Hillary will continue to champion civil rights and honor the legacy of African American trailblazers.
Third, improving healthcare in Indian Country will be at the top of my national agenda. It is unacceptable that the average life expectancy for American Indians is nearly five years less than the rest of the population. It is unacceptable that Native Americans are more than four times as likely to die from diabetes and more than 50% more likely to die from pneumonia or influenza. It is unacceptable that while the federal government spends nearly $6,000 for each Medicare recipient -- it spends only $2,000 per person for Indian Health Service medical care.
When I'm President, Indian healthcare will be a national priority along with quality, affordable care for every single Native American family. I won't rest until I get it done.
Finally, on this observation of Veterans Day, I want you to know that as President, I will stand up for our veterans every day. As you know, Native Americans have one of the highest rates of service of any group in America. At the end of the twentieth century, we had nearly 200,000 Native American veterans in America. I believe one of the most fundamental obligations of the next President is to keep faith with these veterans -- to provide the healthcare and benefits they've earned and the respect and gratitude they deserve. So I'll fully fund the VA, I'll cut the red tape, I'll create a new GI Bill for a new generation of veterans. I will never back down and never stop fighting for those who fought for us.
Americans are anxious about more than the housing crisis. They are worried about an economy that is producing stagnant wages for middle class families. Productivity has risen 18 percent in six years, yet wages have stayed flat, and family incomes have fallen by nearly $1,000. Addressing our housing crisis is only one component of Hillary's broader agenda to restore shared prosperity for America's middle class. For seven years, middle-class families have been struggling with declining incomes and skyrocketing costs. Hillary Clinton has proposed a package of middle class tax cuts to help families realize the American Dream by rewarding work, making college affordable, ensuring healthcare is affordable, and encouraging savings and wealth creation. As President, she will:
As a Senator from New York I worked to rebuild New York City after the 9/11 attacks and to provide healthcare to the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it. And many of them—

So many of us grew up with that. You know, we were raised to believe that if you worked hard and if you played by rules you'd be able to build a better life for yourself and your family. Well, I don't think in the last six years our country has actually been living up to that basic bargain. The leadership here in Washington seems to ignore middle class and hardworking families across our country. Under this president's leadership household debt has soared, healthcare costs have skyrocketed, assuming that you have it. Wages have remained stagnant. Now corporate profits are up. And productivity is up, which means Americans are working harder than anybody in the world, but we're not getting rewarded. I'll tell you who is getting rewarded. Companies like Halliburton are getting rewarded with no-bid contracts, then they move their CEOs across the ocean to another country and leave us hanging right here at home.
You know, for six long years, our President has not seen the vast majority of Americans. Not our middle class, not our working families. He's looked right through them. To him, they're invisible. You know, if you're a child sitting in a crumbling school, you're invisible. If you're a small business owner who worries about energy costs or someone who can't afford to fill up your tank -- you're invisible. If you're a hardworking parent who needs affordable childcare while you go to work -- you're invisible. Even if you're a soldier returning from combat who needs healthcare and disability compensation, you are invisible. Well, those days are over.
And I worked for four years with Senator Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, to provide access to Tricare for National Guard and Reserve members. When I got to the Senate I'm sure many people thought I would never talk to Lindsey Graham, let alone work with him, but I decided that we had a job to do and he in South Carolina and I in New York were seeing the same thingsâ€”that is, our National Guard and Reserve troops were being activated to go to Iraq or Afghanistan, many of them were considered medically unready because they were uninsured in their private civilian lives. They worked for employers who didn't provide insurance, they were self employed and couldn't afford it, they were young and didn't think that they had to really worry about their health but a thorough exam found problems. So Senator Graham and I said we're going to make sure that if you're a National Guard or Reserve member, you will have access to healthcare and you'll be part of this great American military from the very beginning. We will take care of you and your families.
"As the next President of the United States, Hillary will lead this nation in a direction of hope, change and prosperity," said Assemblymember Juan Arambula (D-Fresno). "Senator Clinton is the most qualified candidate in the race having tackled such critical issues as healthcare, education, job creation and a strong defense. Hillary Clinton is a positive change for our country and most especially for the Central Valley. I am proud and honored to offer my strong endorsement for Senator Hillary Clinton. "
Here at home, during my time in the Senate, I have cherished the opportunity to work with my women colleagues in both Houses and on both sides of the aisle. Now we may not see eye to eye on everything, but we get together and we trade those very important bits of advice like what kind of shoes to wear on marble floors when you're on your feet all day. And when it comes to the issues that we can agree on -- whether it's afterschool funding or healthcare and education for women here in America or for women in Afghanistan-- we are a force to be reckoned with.
From quality, affordable healthcare for every American to retirement security for every American. Paid leave. Flexible workplaces.
No one knows the stakes in this election better than our First Lady. Because all the progress that we've achieved under President Obama's leadership is at stake – he pulled our economy out of the biggest ditch that it was in when he became president. He saved the auto industry, he cracked down on Wall Street, he has tackled healthcare, climate change, civil rights, and so much else.

"We should put politics aside and unite behind a common goal: helping women prevent unintended pregnancies in the first place. Through access to education, contraception, and quality healthcare we can empower women to make safe, affordable, evidence-based family planning decisions," said Senator Clinton.
"When our brave men and women go to war, they should expect to be supported before they leave and be treated as heroes when they return, with the promise of adequate assistance and healthcare. That is the promise our country must keep to the men and women who enlist, who fight, and who return home often bearing the visible and invisible scars of sacrifice. This should be a time when we do more for our troops and their families, not less," Senator Clinton said.
As New York's first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have the healthcare and support they need. She has pressed for an independent investigation of the conditions at Walter Reed and called for a new GI Bill of Rights to once again honor the service and invest in the future of our men and women in uniform. She authored legislation signed into law last year that required an audit of widespread pay issues wounded soldiers are facing, recently released by the Army showing continuing problems. Senator Clinton has fought to ensure servicemembers have the body armor they need. She has also secured in law access to TRICARE military health benefits for all drilling members of the National Guard and Reserves and their families.

She has called for a new GI Bill of Rights to reenergize and renew our commitment to those who wear our uniform. She has been a leading voice for making sure our troops have adequate body armor. She has worked for healthcare that recognizes the new realities facing our men and women in uniform and that honors our responsibility to our veterans. She has been an advocate for wounded troops stuck in red tape, and she has worked to stop in their tracks those who prey on soldiers trying to do the right thing for their families. In recognition of tireless efforts, Senator Clinton has received numerous honors, including the Inspirational Leadership Award from the Military Order of the Purple Heart for her dedicated service to America's servicemembers and veterans.
"Today, Equal Pay Day, we recognize this distressing gap and the impact it has on our families. Working women -- our neighbors -- do not get a discount on essentials for their families, costs like food, rent, healthcare or education," said Florida Arthenia Joyner. "Senator Clinton is taking a leadership role in addressing this issue in Congress, and I urge others to support her."

As a Senator, Hillary has championed legislation that will help create good jobs, develop new sources of capital, and invest in education, healthcare, broadband, agriculture, biofuels and other renewable energy sources in order to grow the economies of rural America. Senator Clinton has been a tireless advocate of restoring the promise of rural and small town America. She has worked to expand access to broadband and spur innovative strategies for rural economic development. In a major speech last year, Senator Clinton addressed the many challenges facing rural communities and called for new strategies to preserve the quality of life and keep good jobs in rural and small-town communities.
We spend 16 percent of our gross domestic product - $2 trillion -- on health care. And by 2016, health costs are scheduled to exceed $4 trillion, or almost 20% of GDP. That means that within less than 10 years, 20 cents out of every dollar produced in America will be spent on healthcare. No other country spends more than 12%, a difference of more than $500 billion. All other wealthy countries spend even less. We spend $5,711 per patient. The next highest spending country, Switzerland, spends $3,847 on patients. Yet, they cover every single one of their citizens and have an average life expectancy that is three years longer than ours.
Today, I'm announcing a seven point plan to lower health care costs for all American and again to make our healthcare system, without doubt from any corner, the best in the world. Building a national consensus around these cost savings is the first crucial step to cover all Americans with quality, affordable healthcare.
Last year I was at the hospital here at GW announcing legislation that has since passed the Senate that promotes the use of information technology so we can end the paper chase, limit medical errors and reduce the number of malpractice suits. It would allow us to use IT to develop a nationwide, interoperable system, to streamline our healthcare costs, and, I believe, reduce errors as well. Now, I'm proud of my legislation, we didn't get it passed in the House last year, we're going to try again this year. But if we don't get it passed, I will have it as one of my highest priorities as President. I'm going to build on that legislation by requiring health providers that participate in federal programs, which is nearly all of them, to adopt private, secure, and interoperable technology. And to help hospitals and doctors modernize their systems and promote the widespread adoption of health IT, I would invest $3 billion a year in grants to help ramp up the system. No more yellowing paper records -- no more trying to decipher messy handwriting.
Now how will this actually work? Well it has to be implemented over time according again to Rand who has been studying healthcare costs intensely now for several years. We could save $147 billion dollars from the information technology changes I have recommended, $20 to $30 billion dollars in administrative savings every year, $25 billion in savings from overpayments for pharmaceuticals and health plans, and there are billions more in countless other inefficiencies that could be rung out of our often wasteful health care system. We also will have to move toward a system where it is doctor-patient centered and consumer driven if we expect to really get the results that we need. Now there is no question that at least $120 billion dollars in projected savings that I have included in my plan are not only reasonable, but extremely conservative.
So I believe that equally importantly to having a plan, we have to have a political consensus and that is what I am trying to develop as I talk about healthcare and engage in a conversation with the American people because I think Americans are ready for change. They are ready for a healthcare system that produces better results at lower cost and ends the shame of us not covering 45 million plus of our fellow Americans.
"I have had the privilege of working with Hillary Clinton since 1993, and her depth of experience makes her uniquely qualified to be President," Senator Inouye said. "She has been a tireless advocate for our soldiers and veterans, fighting for life-saving body armor when they deploy, and the healthcare and benefits they deserve when they return home.
Clinton has been a longtime advocate for veterans, calling attention to Gulf War Syndrome as First Lady, and leading efforts in Congress to provide life-saving armor for our troops and their vehicles in Iraq. She recently proposed a new GI Bill of Rights, which would expand opportunities for veterans to pursue education and home ownership and provide low-interest loans to start their own businesses. Her bill would also cut red tape for military personnel to receive the benefits and the healthcare they need, and crack down on predatory lenders who target military families.
She created a health tracking system for all active duty personnel and Reservists to ensure that they receive regular check ups; and expanded access to military healthcare benefits (TRICARE) for all Guard and Reserve members whether they are on active duty or not in order to prevent another illness like Gulf War Syndrome.

Hillary Clinton laid out her progressive vision for strengthening the middle class in the face of rising income inequality and globalization today. In a speech at the Manchester School of Technology in New Hampshire, she called for a return to shared prosperity and tax fairness, while expanding access to quality education and healthcare for all Americans.
Villaraigosa previously served as Speaker of the California Assembly, passing legislation to expand children's healthcare, ban assault weapons and create the largest network of urban neighborhood parks in the country.
Lansing civic leader and Michigan State Trustee Joel Ferguson said, "Hillary Clinton has devoted her life to expanding opportunity for all Americans. She is a leader Michigan can trust to address our priorities -- strengthening our economy, creating and protecting jobs, improving education and demanding universal healthcare. Hillary has been tackling the tough issues facing our country for three decades. No one would be a better partner for Michigan and its workers, and no one is better prepared to be President."

"From healthcare to education to caring for our veterans, she has been a champion for the millions of Americans who have been invisible to this administration. Her depth of experience and her strength of character make her uniquely suited to be President."
"I am demonstrating my support for Senator Clinton's presidential bid by serving on the National Mayors Council," said Mayor Johnson, who will serve as one of 11 council co-chairs. "I am a firm believer that Senator Clinton's experience, intelligence and compassion will serve as galvanizing forces to change course and lead our country in the right direction. As president, Senator Clinton will fight to ensure that Americans living in rural communities like Lovelock, have equal access to affordable healthcare, good education and other programs to make the United States and its citizens the strongest they can be."
"Senator Clinton's unmatched experience makes her the most qualified candidate to be our next President," said Vermont State Senator Hinda Miller. "People throughout the county, including those right here in Vermont, will benefit from the Senator's commitment to government reform, repairing our healthcare system, and providing affordable quality education.
Mayor Newsom has embraced brought fresh ideas and renewed energy to the City of San Francisco since he was elected in 2003. He has earned a reputation as an innovator on issues ranging from equality to homelessness. He has also championed important issues such as the environment, healthcare, and education.

Assemblyman Solorio, Chairman of the Assembly Public Safety Committee, represents the 69th District of California. Throughout his term, Solorio has been an advocate for the fight against gang violence. He noted Senator Clinton's approach to healthcare and education is commendable and corresponds with much of his own platform.
And I worked for four years with Senator Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, to provide access to Tricare for National Guard and Reserve members.

We will take care of you and your families.
Institute a New "Paperless" Health Information Technology System: Modernizing our health care system through the use of information technology will empower doctors and other healthcare providers to communicate electronically and will reduce waste and redundancy while improving safety and quality by reducing medical errors. Overall, the RAND Corporation estimates net savings to be $77 billion per year. An up-front and phased-out $3 billion a year investment fund would be provided to help hospitals and doctor's offices adopt and implement HIT. The proposal will give doctors financial incentives to adopt health IT and facilitate adoption of a system where high quality care and better patient outcomes can be rewarded.
Create an Independent "Best Practices" Institute and Invest in Research for New Treatments: Patients, providers, and payers would benefit from getting better information on what works in health care and how treatments compare to one another. Researchers at Dartmouth have found that more care is not better care, and that inefficient care may do more harm than good. Therefore she will create a new Best Practices Institute, which would be funded by both the private and public sectors, since its results will benefit all payers. Research will compare the effectiveness of alternative treatments such as pharmaceuticals, devices, and surgeries. For example, information supplied by organizations such as the Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP) has been used in North Carolina to educate providers and improve quality of care, saving the state an estimated $80 million in 2003. This research will facilitate the development of quality and outcomes measures for use by hospitals, physicians, nursing homes, and other healthcare providers.
"I believe Hillary Clinton has what it takes to get us out of Iraq and back on track in tackling our real priorities," said Portland City Commissioner Erik Sten. "Our families need healthcare, early education and jobs that make a living wage. By investing in American ingenuity to stop global warming, we can build an economy and place in the world that is sustainable. Hillary will do the hard work in Washington that we need to be successful in Oregon."
"Her commitment to promoting policies to develop alternative energy technologies and fighting global warming are only two of the many issues in which Hillary has shown her ability to lead. Senator Clinton also has a long record of working on issues that are important to women and to Latino families, such as education, healthcare and economic empowerment. I look forward to working to help elect Hillary the next president of the United States."

Wallner, who has spent much of her career in the legislature working to increase financial support for children's daycare organizations, also serves on the Board of NH Healthy Kids, an organization that oversees the implementation of the state's children's healthcare programs. In addition to showing her commitment to New Hampshire families through the legislature, Wallner has a distinguished, nearly 35-year career as a childcare advocate. She currently serves as the executive director of the Blueberry Express Day Care Center in Pittsfield and for two locations of the non-profit Merrimack Valley Day Care Service in Concord that combined provide care for nearly 200 children, many of whom come from low and moderate income families.
"Senator Clinton has the wisdom, passion and commitment to children and families that will make her a great President," said McLeod. "She has made healthcare a priority throughout her career as an attorney, First Lady, and United States Senator, and I know she will continue to do so when she is President."
"I am thrilled and honored to have Martha's support," said Senator Clinton. "We share a common passion and commitment to providing quality healthcare to working families. I look forward to having her on my campaign and to having her with me when I return to the North Country to talk with families about my plan to insure every child and ensure access to quality, affordable healthcare to all Americans."

In a new video released on her web site, Hillary Clinton details her legislation announced today aimed at providing all children with access to quality, affordable healthcare coverage. The "HillCast" is part of a regular series of web broadcasts Senator Clinton will deliver over the coming months on important issues facing Americans.
"Making health care accessible and affordable for all children will keep kids healthy, save lives, control costs, and end heartache and worry for so many parents," Clinton said today. "This plan is practical and fiscally responsible -- it will honor our values and prevent kids from needing more costly healthcare in the future."
Six million children are already eligible for the State Children's Health Insurance Plan (SCHIP) but not enrolled. Clinton's legislation includes incentives for states to expand children's healthcare to those who are not eligible, and identify and enroll uninsured kids that already qualify for coverage.
Thank you so much. And I could not have had a better economic development partner in Upstate New York than Lee Beaulac and Rural Opportunities, Inc. We've had a lot of fun. It has been challenging and sometimes frustrating to bring people together to talk about what we were going to do to reinvest in communities and provide economic opportunities and housing and healthcare, microcredit and just a whole a range of issues that we have worked on together for the last six years. But Lee does know how the public sector and the private sector both work and he combines that knowledge with a real passion to improve the lives of people. So I want to thank you in front of all of your peers and your colleagues, someone who I am very grateful to work with and I am so pleased that he could introduce me.
You know Americans are struggling to pay for college costs and energy costs and healthcare costs, because after all, premiums have gone up 90 percent since 2000. And I'm concerned that we're not facing the problems that we have. We're not meeting our challenges the way previous generations of Americans did.
We brought electricity to rural communities, we brought interstate highway systems, we're going to bring broadband deployment so that every community can be connected up to the global economy. We're going to have a new housing project program that is going to invest in local communities. We're going to have universal healthcare coverage and we're going to use energy to create new jobs. We can do this.
Lisa Heddens, the Family Support Coordinator for the Access for Special Kids (ASK) Resource Center in Iowa said of Clinton's legislation, "This initiative has the potential to make a positive difference in the lives of those affected by autism in Iowa. I'm thrilled that Senator Clinton has taken this important step to address mental healthcare in Congress."
"What I learned when I first met Hillary, and what I know now, is that she is qualified to lead this country. As a young woman, mother, advocate, First Lady and Senator she has continually shown us she is passionate about improving family issues, healthcare, equal pay and the challenges that people all across this nation face on a daily basis," King said. "Hillary and I both believe strongly in equal rights and opportunities for all people. She is a winner and I am standing beside her because she has the vision, the drive and the knowledge to lead this country."
"We should put politics aside and unite behind a common goal: helping women prevent unintended pregnancies in the first place.

Senator DeVries was joined today by former Massachusetts Lt. Governor Evelyn Murphy, President of the WAGE Project, which is a national organization working to end wage discrimination against working women and women supporting Clinton from across the state. The more than 500 women represent the first women signing on in support of Senator Clinton. They include educators, seniors, healthcare workers, mothers, community activists and business leaders from 118 towns across the state and all 10 New Hampshire counties.

I'm going to build on that legislation by requiring health providers that participate in federal programs, which is nearly all of them, to adopt private, secure, and interoperable technology. And to help hospitals and doctors modernize their systems and promote the widespread adoption of health IT, I would invest $3 billion a year in grants to help ramp up the system. No more yellowing paper records -- no more trying to decipher messy handwriting.
Now how will this actually work? Well it has to be implemented over time according again to Rand who has been studying healthcare costs intensely now for several years. We could save $147 billion dollars from the information technology changes I have recommended, $20 to $30 billion dollars in administrative savings every year, $25 billion in savings from overpayments for pharmaceuticals and health plans, and there are billions more in countless other inefficiencies that could be rung out of our often wasteful health care system. We also will have to move toward a system where it is doctor-patient centered and consumer driven if we expect to really get the results that we need. Now there is no question that at least $120 billion dollars in projected savings that I have included in my plan are not only reasonable, but extremely conservative.
So I believe that equally importantly to having a plan, we have to have a political consensus and that is what I am trying to develop as I talk about healthcare and engage in a conversation with the American people because I think Americans are ready for change. They are ready for a healthcare system that produces better results at lower cost and ends the shame of us not covering 45 million plus of our fellow Americans.
"I have had the privilege of working with Hillary Clinton since 1993, and her depth of experience makes her uniquely qualified to be President," Senator Inouye said. "She has been a tireless advocate for our soldiers and veterans, fighting for life-saving body armor when they deploy, and the healthcare and benefits they deserve when they return home.
Clinton has been a longtime advocate for veterans, calling attention to Gulf War Syndrome as First Lady, and leading efforts in Congress to provide life-saving armor for our troops and their vehicles in Iraq. She recently proposed a new GI Bill of Rights, which would expand opportunities for veterans to pursue education and home ownership and provide low-interest loans to start their own businesses. Her bill would also cut red tape for military personnel to receive the benefits and the healthcare they need, and crack down on predatory lenders who target military families.
She created a health tracking system for all active duty personnel and Reservists to ensure that they receive regular check ups; and expanded access to military healthcare benefits (TRICARE) for all Guard and Reserve members whether they are on active duty or not in order to prevent another illness like Gulf War Syndrome.

"We commend Senator Obama for entering the healthcare debate and supporting incentives to make healthcare more affordable; Senator Clinton has long fought to expand healthcare coverage and initiated the State Children's Health Insurance Program that now covers 6 million children and has led the fight in the Senate to pass health information technology.
"Senator Clinton believes that in addition to making healthcare more accessible, we have to achieve true universal healthcare so that every American has health care coverage."
In May, Hillary spoke to firefighters from across the country in Portsmouth and highlighted her plan to provide health insurance to every child in America with mothers and healthcare professionals at Exeter Hospital; we had a tremendously successful grassroots Day of Action on May 12th with supporters and volunteers reaching out to thousands of New Hampshire households; National Campaign Co-Chair and former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack and First Lady Christie Vilsack criss-crossed the state campaigning on May 23rd and 24th in Plymouth, Manchester, Epping, Portsmouth and Dover; and State Senator Deb Reynolds announced her endorsement of Senator Clinton at Thomas Roberts Salon and Barber Shop in Plymouth on May 23rd.
"Highlights include more corporate responsibility, quality healthcare and affordable college tuition...this is the first time a candidate has packed them together as a policy initiative. Her goal was to ensure that working families share in America's prosperity."

"The 2008 Presidential election could be this nation's last opportunity to elect a President who can regain our position as '˜most dominant' in the global landscape we call home. We need a President, who understands the needs of '˜working-class America', one who will reverse the staggering number of lost manufacturing jobs. We need an individual who can craft a healthcare plan that is comprehensive, for all people, that is focused on quality of delivery and cost of care. We need an individual that understands that National Security is as much about strategic tactics and negotiation, as it is about flexing muscle. This election is not about gender, race, or political party for that matter. It is about credentials, and the skills and abilities to get the job done. After assessing the credentials of all candidates, I am firmly convinced that there is no better candidate than Senator Clinton to lead that change."
"I am demonstrating my support for Senator Clinton's presidential bid by serving on the National Mayors Council," said Mayor Johnson, who will serve as one of 11 council co-chairs. "I am a firm believer that Senator Clinton's experience, intelligence and compassion will serve as galvanizing forces to change course and lead our country in the right direction. As president, Senator Clinton will fight to ensure that Americans living in rural communities like Lovelock, have equal access to affordable healthcare, good education and other programs to make the United States and its citizens the strongest they can be."
"Senator Clinton's unmatched experience makes her the most qualified candidate to be our next President," said Vermont State Senator Hinda Miller.

"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to restore America's place around the world."
"Hillary Clinton has answers for the questions on how to revitalize our urban communities. Her approach to handling public safety, youth violence and crime is timely. She is relevant because she will implement a comprehensive healthcare, employment and economic development plan. Because of her experience, she can extend and expand upon both Bill Clinton's and Lyndon Johnson's initiatives," said Paul Cobb, Bay Area community leader and publisher of the Oakland Post.
Throughout her career, Hillary Clinton has worked to protect civil rights and expand opportunities for African Americans. As President, Hillary Clinton will work to increase opportunities for African Americans - by improving our schools and our healthcare system, expanding access to capital, putting home ownership back in reach, cracking down on predatory lenders targeting African American communities, and making a national commitment to support young men of color who have fallen off track. Hillary will continue to champion civil rights and honor the legacy of African American trailblazers.
Assemblyman Solorio, Chairman of the Assembly Public Safety Committee, represents the 69th District of California. Throughout his term, Solorio has been an advocate for the fight against gang violence. He noted Senator Clinton's approach to healthcare and education is commendable and corresponds with much of his own platform.
Gallup: 'Her 91% rating among democrats on healthcare is the highest for any candidate on any issue within their own party': The Clinton administration's unsuccessful attempt to pass comprehensive healthcare reform in 1993-1994 has not shaken Democrats' (or independents') confidence in her to recommend the right thing for healthcare. Her 91% rating among Democrats on healthcare is the highest for any candidate on any issue within their own party. [Gallup Poll, 7/23-26/07 ]
Today, Hillary is fighting President Bush's efforts to block bi-partisan SCHIP expansion: "So first and foremost, we have to keep the existing program going, but we all believe that it is important to try to expand its coverage beyond the nearly six million that it covers now because John is absolutely right, as every one of us knows, a child with a physical illness, dental problems, other undiagnosed ailments — behavioral or even mental — is not going to be successful. And it is just wrong for the president to threaten to veto this effort to expand the children's health insurance program. So we're going to do everything we can to pass this program. And if he wants to have part of his legacy be vetoing the child health insurance program then we'll try to override the veto because this is absolutely an imperative. There are lots of examples of how children are not successful in school because they don't have access to quality, affordable healthcare. I just think it's outrageous and offensive that the President would threaten to veto this legislation." [Remarks at the Center for American Progress, 7/25/07]
And I worked for four years with Senator Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, to provide access to Tricare for National Guard and Reserve members. When I got to the Senate I'm sure many people thought I would never talk to Lindsey Graham, let alone work with him, but I decided that we had a job to do and he in South Carolina and I in New York were seeing the same thingsâ€”that is, our National Guard and Reserve troops were being activated to go to Iraq or Afghanistan, many of them were considered medically unready because they were uninsured in their private civilian lives. They worked for employers who didn't provide insurance, they were self employed and couldn't afford it, they were young and didn't think that they had to really worry about their health but a thorough exam found problems. So Senator Graham and I said we're going to make sure that if you're a National Guard or Reserve member, you will have access to healthcare and you'll be part of this great American military from the very beginning. We will take care of you and your families.
It would be interesting to know just as historic fact when the first pediatric lipid specialist was certified because one thinks about cholesterol as a problem of us, the adult world. And now we know, as Dr. Lynch too well knows, with her advocacy on behalf of physical activity and trying to stem the tide of obesity among our children, how significant this is and I'm just absolutely delighted that she could be here today. It's also a pleasure being back here. I just had the opportunity to say hello to some of the physicians and nurses and staff members who run this great center. And a number of them reminded me that I was here in 1993, I actually met some of them before this occasion and I am thrilled to be back because I cannot imagine a more fitting place to talk about improving healthcare quality in America than at this institution which has helped to set the standard for excellence for more than 200 years.
Now despite the scars I carry from that, I also have learned some valuable lessons. And most importantly, that in order to answer any question about what we can do better to provide healthcare for all of our citizens in a cost effective quality driven way, we first have to establish a consensus in America. That this is a goal we intend to achieve together. We have to reach that consensus among providers, employers, employees, citizens, those who pay for, depend upon, and actually deliver healthcare services. And this consensus has to be strong enough to persuade decision makers in Washington and to overcome entrenched opposition among the forces that oppose change for ideological and corporate reasons.
And until recently, government at all levels did not use its enormous buying power to empower providers and patients to demand and deliver quality. We plod along with a twentieth century health care system, unable to take full advantage of 21st century medical advances, stuck in the same rut of fatalistic thinking that's defined our healthcare debate for more than a decade. If we try to cover everyone, the argument goes -- we'll lower quality. If we try to improve quality -- we'll break the bank. Our health care problems are too big, too deep, too complicated, the argument continues, for us to solve.
Take the example of Kaiser Permanente. Their management came together with 40 unions representing 90,000 healthcare workers and staff and formed a Labor Management Partnership. The Partnership works to solve problems, improve patient care and give everyone a seat at the table.
Since Kaiser's partnership began, costs have fallen, workplace injuries have fallen -- and patient satisfaction and employee retention have improved. And this is just one example of how, across America, workers and management can improve healthcare quality.
But in the end, quality health care isn't just about savings or statistics. It's about something much more fundamental: the relationship between physicians and patients, between nurses and patients, between physicians, nurses and hospital administrators. That's what's at the heart of our quality, how we get along with one another, what our relationships are. The moment when someone in need seeks you out, they're scared and vulnerable, they want you to do what can get them better, but too often our healthcare system stands in the way, blocking that relationship, preventing physicians and nurses from doing what they would want to do. So therefore, we have to change the system.
The VA is a great example of a healthcare system that has dramatically improved the quality of patient care. The American Consumer Satisfaction Index Survey shows that VA patients were significantly more satisfied with both inpatient and outpatient care than patients in the private medical system. The New England Journal of Medicine found that VA healthcare ranked higher than Medicare in 12 out of 13 measurements of quality and the VA system achieves better rates of quality care for diabetics than commercial managed care organizations.
The VA medical records system supports the use of advanced technology including mobile devices, wireless interfaces, and a barcode medication administration system in which patients are given a bar-coded ID tag. Nurses scan this tag when providing medications allowing them to confirm that the right person receives the right medicine at the right time. So the VA is doing it, there's no reason we can't do it across our healthcare system,
This is simply unacceptable in our country. The quality of your care should have nothing to do with your ethnicity, skin color, or gender. And when I'm President, I will see to it that it doesn't. I will start by directing the Department of Health and Human Services to collect detailed, up-to-date information on healthcare disparities, so we actually can know the full extent of the .
Hospitals are paid for each episode of care, each hospitalization. Doctors are paid for each office visit, each procedure. People aren't paid to coordinate patients' treatments to ensure they get the best quality care. So let's say you are a diabetic with high blood pressure. Your doctor won't be reimbursed for hiring a nutritionist to track your weight and help you understand what you can and can't eat. Your hospital won't be reimbursed for hiring a nurse assistant to ensure you have regular appointments to get your feet and eyes checked. Or to make sure your blood pressure doctor and your diabetes doctor communicate with each other about your care. And healthcare providers who wish to work in teams to coordinate services and treat patients holistically receive lower reimbursements than if they all worked separately.
That's exactly how it's done at the Mayo Clinic, one of the most respected health care institutions in America, actually probably in the world. Under their integrated healthcare system, primary care physicians work together with specialists to develop a comprehensive approach to treat each patient. The result is better care, lower costs, and fewer hospitalizations and doctor visits. The result is better care, lower costs, and fewer hospitalizations and doctor visits. In fact, if hospitalizations and doctor visits across America mirrored the numbers at Mayo, for certain conditions, inpatient Medicare spending would decrease 20 percent, Medicare costs for doctor visits would decrease 35 percent. That's billions of dollars in savings. But at the same time physicians salaries are above the national average. So when I'm President, I'll support federal reimbursements for precisely this kind of team approach to medicine. We know it saves money -- and saves lives.
We may have a long road ahead of us, but I believe we're finally moving in the right direction. That we can empower patients to make the right decisions for themselves. We can empower doctors and nurses to deliver the best care that they want to, and are often prevented from doing so. We can have the highest quality health care system in the world and we can do it in a cost-effective manner. That's the direction that I'm headed in. And I'm proud to be at this institution, which has pioneered so many of the changes that benefit us today, and I hope that you'll all join me on this journey to better quality healthcare.
Institute a New "Paperless" Health Information Technology System: Modernizing our health care system through the use of information technology will empower doctors and other healthcare providers to communicate electronically and will reduce waste and redundancy while improving safety and quality by reducing medical errors. Overall, the RAND Corporation estimates net savings to be $77 billion per year. An up-front and phased-out $3 billion a year investment fund would be provided to help hospitals and doctor's offices adopt and implement HIT. The proposal will give doctors financial incentives to adopt health IT and facilitate adoption of a system where high quality care and better patient outcomes can be rewarded.
Create an Independent "Best Practices" Institute and Invest in Research for New Treatments: Patients, providers, and payers would benefit from getting better information on what works in health care and how treatments compare to one another. Researchers at Dartmouth have found that more care is not better care, and that inefficient care may do more harm than good. Therefore she will create a new Best Practices Institute, which would be funded by both the private and public sectors, since its results will benefit all payers. Research will compare the effectiveness of alternative treatments such as pharmaceuticals, devices, and surgeries. For example, information supplied by organizations such as the Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP) has been used in North Carolina to educate providers and improve quality of care, saving the state an estimated $80 million in 2003. This research will facilitate the development of quality and outcomes measures for use by hospitals, physicians, nursing homes, and other healthcare providers.
In the month of August, Hillary Clinton made her 12th and 13th trips to the Granite State. She traveled to Derry, Portsmouth, Rochester, Lebanon, Warner, Concord and Manchester. During those visits, she delivered three policy speeches on important issues that matter to New Hampshire voters including how she will preserve the American dream of homeownership; rebuild America's infrastructure and improve healthcare quality in America.
On Hillary's plan to address healthcare quality...
DiMasi, first elected to the House in 1978 to represent Boston, has served as Speaker since 2004. He was instrumental in passing Massachusetts' landmark healthcare legislation that provides coverage to nearly every resident. For his role in passing the state's healthcare plan, Governing Magazine named DiMasi one of its Public Officials of the Year in 2006.
"At this critical time in our history, Hillary Clinton is the experienced leader this country needs to deliver the change it demands," Sims said. "She will provide the national leadership essential to meeting the challenges of climate change that threaten our economy, environment and public health. She also understands and values the role local governments play as partners in seeking innovative solutions to our most pressing concerns nationally, including providing access to affordable quality healthcare to all Americans."
"I believe Hillary Clinton has what it takes to get us out of Iraq and back on track in tackling our real priorities," said Portland City Commissioner Erik Sten. "Our families need healthcare, early education and jobs that make a living wage. By investing in American ingenuity to stop global warming, we can build an economy and place in the world that is sustainable. Hillary will do the hard work in Washington that we need to be successful in Oregon."
Catherine Baker Knoll was elected in 2003 and became the first woman Lieutenant Governor in Pennsylvania history. During her tenure, she has worked closely with Governor Ed Rendell to promote Prescription for Pennsylvania, which would provide healthcare coverage for everyone in the Keystone State. Baker Knoll has also led efforts to expand Pennsylvania's use of alternative energies to reduce the state's reliance on foreign oil.
With 47 million Americans lacking health insurance, Hillary vowed to establish universal healthcare that includes quality, affordable coverage for every American.
"Senior Leadership Council" to Discuss Senator Clinton's pledge to protect healthcare, financial security for older Americans
"Hillary really cares about senior citizens in this country," added Anita Freedman, who also serves as Treasurer of the Rockingham County Democrats. "She will make sure America's older persons have the healthcare and financial security they deserve."
The Clinton Campaign announced today the endorsement of U.S. Rep. Laura Richardson of Los Angeles. Senator Clinton and Congresswoman Richardson share many issues and initiatives; however Senator Clinton's commitment to equitable access to public education, healthcare, job creation, and economic development earned her the Congresswoman's full endorsement.
In 2006, then Long Beach City Councilwoman Richardson won a seat in the California State Assembly in the 55th District and served as the Assistant Speaker pro Tempore in the Assembly and was recognized as the first African-American woman, South Bay representative, and freshman to hold this prestigious position. In the state legislature, Richardson was dedicated to expanding access to healthcare, empowering public education, and ensuring safe neighborhoods. More recently, Richardson succeeded 16 candidates in a special election to represent the culturally and economically diverse constituents of California's 37th Congressional District.
"We are counting on Hillary Clinton to deliver health care for all of America's families," Buffenbarger said. "Our negotiations often focus on who pays for what level of healthcare, and Senator Clinton's new plan offers American workers and manufacturers far greater choices and dramatically lower premiums."

Good for Small Businesses: Small businesses are the engine of new job growth in the U.S. economy but face bigger challenges when it comes to providing healthcare for their employees. Hillary would give tax credits to small businesses that provide healthcare to their workers to help defray their coverage costs. This will make small businesses more competitive and help create good jobs with health benefits that will stay here in the US.
Hillary Can Get it Done:Nobody has worked harder or longer to improve health care than Hillary Clinton. From her time in Arkansas when she improved rural health care to her successful effort to create the SCHIP Children's Health Insurance program which now covers six million children, Hillary has the strength and experience to ensure that every man, woman and child in America has quality, affordable healthcare.

Hillary's American Health Choices plan unveiled yesterday would improve quality and lower cost while preserving consumer choices. For those who like their health insurance, they could keep it. For the 47 million uninsured and those who don't like their health care coverage, they could choose from a range of private plans or a public plan modeled on Medicare. To read more about Hillary's health care plan, visit www.hillaryclinton.com/healthcare.
"I am proud to endorse Senator Clinton because she understands that access to quality and affordable health care should be available to every American. As President she will make universal healthcare a reality," Dymally added.
Hillary's Granite State Health Corps -- respected leaders in the healthcare community -- will advocate for her health care plan across the state, talking to neighbors, friends, colleagues and attending local events about Hillary's leadership on the issue and what it means for the people of New Hampshire.
For more information on the American Health Choices Plan, visit the campaign's website at www.hillaryclinton.com/healthcare.
Under the American Health Choices Plan, tax credits will be available to help working families cover healthcare costs and insurance companies will no longer be permitted to deny coverage for a pre-existing or genetic condition. For people who change jobs, under the Clinton plan they will not lose their healthcare coverage.
Closing the Quality Gap - Among African Americans who have insurance, it's likely to be lower quality. Only half of black women have employer-based health care compared with two thirds of white women. Nearly a third of African American women experience gaps in their health care coverage over the course of a year compared with less than a quarter of white women. Because of barriers to quality private coverage, African Americans are also more likely to rely on public programs. Close to twenty percent of non-elderly African Americans are enrolled in Medicaid. Forty-five percent of African American children participate in Medicaid - twice the rate of Medicaid coverage of white children. By offering new quality healthcare choices to all Americans, while strengthening our public programs like Medicaid and SCHIP, Senator Clinton's plan will work to close these quality gaps.
Affordable Coverage - Premiums have skyrocketed over the last several years - nearly double since 2000 while incomes have remained stagnant and disparities between African Americans and whites persist. The average income in African American households today is roughly $31,900 compared with $50,700 for whites. In order to ensure that quality health care is affordable, Hillary's plan creates a premium affordability tax credit that will ensure that no family has to choose between the mortgage and their healthcare bills. [Working families will receive a refundable tax credit to help them afford high-quality health coverage.
Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care - In 2003, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found "that racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities are national problems that affect health care at all points in the process, at all sites of care, and for all medical conditions - in fact, disparities are pervasive in our health care system." Hillary's plan requires the development and testing of quality measures for use by doctors, hospitals, nursing homes and other providers targeted at eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care. It directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop a uniform reporting format for the collection of quality information on race and ethnicity, so that we can know the full extent of the problem and measure our progress in addressing it. It provides $50 million in federal funding for the development of culturally and linguistically competent clinical care programs, to ensure that our healthcare providers can communicate with their patients and have training and skills to fully understand and respect cultural differences in the patients they serve. The plan addresses diversity and cultural competency in the healthcare workforce by providing opportunities and incentives to encourage greater diversity in our health care workforce through recruitment initiatives, scholarships and loan-forgiveness programs.
Under this plan, all Americans can keep their current insurance, choose a new private plan or take part in a public plan like Medicare. Insurance will be portable and safe from discrimination on the basis of chronic or pre-existing conditions.

On Monday, September 17, Hillary Clinton unveiled the third part of her plan to ensure that all Americans have affordable, quality health insurance. Her American Health Choices Plan will provide quality, affordable healthcare to all Americans - including the 496,000 uninsured Nevada residents and the tens of thousands of Nevada workers with coverage who fear they could be one pink slip away from losing their health coverage. [U.S. Census, 2007]. For Nevada residents with health insurance, the plan builds on the current system to give businesses and their employees greater choice of health plans - including keeping the one they have - while lowering cost and improving quality.
All Nevada residents will benefit from lower costs and greater security under Senator Clinton's plan. Like families across the country, Nevada families have been squeezed by skyrocketing health costs - family premiums are up 58% since 2000. [HHS, 2006]. Senator Clinton has a comprehensive plan to reduce health care costs by modernizing our healthcare infrastructure that will result in tangible savings for Nevada families. According to a recent estimate by the Business Roundtable, AARP and SEIU, Senator Clinton's plan to institute a paperless health information technology system could save $165 billion per year - or $2200 for a typical family.
Senator Clinton recognizes that rising healthcare costs are affecting the ability of Nevada businesses to compete in the global marketplace and create good, high-paying jobs here in the U.S. Her American Health Choices Plan makes health care more affordable for businesses by ending cost-shifting, increasing insurance options, providing relief for retiree health care costs, and by assuring quality and value in our health care system.
Under Senator Clinton's plan, the 150,000 New Hampshire residents who have no health insurance-including 19,000 children-will finally receive quality, affordable healthcare. New Hampshire has seen a 51 percent increase in the number of uninsured since President Bush took office. [Census, 2007]. Senator Clinton's plan will help reverse this trend by providing new refundable tax credits to help cover the cost of high-quality health coverage for all New Hampshire residents. Those credits will guarantee that securing quality health care never becomes a crushing burden for New Hampshire families, by guaranteeing that premiums never rise above a certain percentage of family income.
Jackie and Chuck Rossier of Merrimack have struggled with personal health issues for many years while battling insurance companies and hospitals over coverage and quality care. They have resorted to paying medical expenses with a credit card, exceeding $9,000 in 2005. They are supporting Hillary Clinton. "We strongly believe that she will be able to deliver affordable healthcare to everyone," said Chuck.
"Hillary has shown that healthcare is a very important issue to her, and her focus is genuine," said Dr. Stuart Glassman of Bedford, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Community and Family Medicine at Dartmouth College Medical School. "I work with veterans and persons with disabilities, and she has a good understanding of the needs of people who are at a disadvantage."
Under this plan, all Americans can keep their current insurance, choose a new private plan or take part in a public plan like Medicare. Insurance will be portable and safe from discrimination on the basis of chronic or pre-existing conditions.

On Monday, September 17, Hillary Clinton unveiled the third part of her plan to ensure that all Americans have affordable, quality health insurance. Her American Health Choices Plan will provide quality, affordable healthcare to all Americans - including the 150,000 uninsured New Hampshire residents and the tens of thousands of New Hampshire workers with coverage who fear they could be one pink slip away from losing their health coverage. [US Census, 2007] For New Hampshire residents with health insurance, the plan builds on the current system to give businesses and their employees greater choice of health plans - including keeping the one they have - while lowering cost and improving quality.
All New Hampshire residents will benefit from lower costs and greater security under Senator Clinton's plan. Like families across the country, New Hampshire residents have been squeezed by skyrocketing health costs-family premiums are up 53% since 2000. [HHS, 2006]. Senator Clinton has a comprehensive plan to reduce health care costs by modernizing our healthcare infrastructure that will result in tangible savings for New Hampshire families. According to a recent estimate by the Business Roundtable, AARP and SEIU, Senator Clinton's plan to institute a paperless health information technology system could save $165 billion per year-or $2,200 for a typical family.
"I'm frustrated when I see families who have lost health insurance and delay treatment until it becomes a medical emergency. Every person deserves healthcare," said pediatrician Julie Thomas of Cedar Rapids. "Without Hillary Clinton, universal healthcare would not even be an issue and I support her because she is the only candidate with the strength and experience to finish the battle."

The American Health Choices Plan creates a premium affordability tax credit that will ensure that no family has to choose between paying their mortgage and paying for health care. Insurance companies will no longer be allowed to deny coverage for a pre-existing or genetic condition. Under the Clinton plan, people who change jobs will not lose their healthcare coverage.
Senator Clinton's plan to ensure universal health coverage is vital to closing the disturbing racial and ethnic health disparities that are pervasive throughout our health care system. While many factors, such as the environment, contribute to the disparities in health outcomes, no factor matters more than access to health insurance. Disparities in health outcomes mirror disparities in health insurance coverage: about one third of all Hispanics and nearly one quarter of Hispanic children are without health insurance; on both counts, these are higher figures than those for any other racial or ethnic group. Approximately one-half of foreign-born Hispanics are uninsured. Hispanics are also least likely to have employer-sponsored coverage of any racial or ethnic group-only 40 percent of Hispanics have health insurance through their employers compared with 69 percent of non-Hispanic whites. Furthermore, as the Latino population has grown in the United States, the health coverage situation has deteriorated. Between 1994 and 2004, the number of Hispanics without a regular source of healthcare grew from 29 to 31 percent even though it shrank among every other ethnic and racial group.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to get our troops home safely from Iraq and tackle the tough challenges we face at home, from moving toward energy independence to establishing universal healthcare for every American," Sanders said. "Hillary is uniquely qualified to deliver the change this country needs."
"Hillary's health care policy is the most comprehensive and her experience will help her pass healthcare reform when she is President," added State Representative and RN, Trinka Russell of Stratham.

She has fought for healthcare, quality schools, and working families her entire life. As President, she will lead a government that serves all Americans.
Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY) introduced Senate legislation that will raise awareness about the availability of emergency contraception also known as Plan B or the "morning-after" pill. The bill authorizes an education campaign to better inform women and healthcare providers of emergency contraception. Representative Louise Slaughter (D-NY) has already introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Senator Clinton has been a champion of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which has helped more than 50 million Americans since President Clinton signed it into law in 1993. Senator Clinton has worked to build on this landmark law, cosponsoring the Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act and the Healthy Families Act. She has also introduced legislation to extend the Family and Medical Leave Act to flight attendants and pilots. As New York's first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform and their families have the healthcare and support they need, most recently securing a series of measures in the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act approved unanimously by the Senate.
Hillary's American Health Choices plan unveiled last month would improve quality and lower costs while preserving consumer choices. For those who like their health insurance, they could keep it. For the 47 million uninsured and those who don't like their health care coverage, they could choose from a range of private plans or a public plan modeled on Medicare.

Russell is a fourth generation Iowa farmer and Mary Jo runs her own small business, but because both Mary Jo and Russell have pre-existing health conditions, they cannot afford insurance so they pay for their healthcare out of pocket, $1000 a month for prescription drugs alone. When Russell got sick, and the medical bills started piling up, they had to sell off half of their farm to pay their medical bills. It was their only option.
"We have to change our economic course just as we have to change course in Iraq, and change course when it comes to healthcare. When it comes to the economy, I believe I have the strength and experience to make that change -- to make our economy work again for middle class and for all Americans."

"Hillary cares about hardworking people and she has the experience to enact the reform this country needs from strengthening public education to providing affordable healthcare for every American and ensuring stronger security at home and abroad," Estabrook said.
These trends reflect the fact that Hillary's message of experience and change is resonating with voters as the first primary contests grow closer. She spent the last week explaining her programs to rebuild the middle class after 7 years of neglect by President Bush (See: David Brooks ; New York Daily News), following on her well received healthcare plan. She is outlining her vision for change and talking with the voters about her ideas.

"As the next President of the United States, Hillary will lead this nation in a direction of hope, change and prosperity," said Assemblymember Juan Arambula (D-Fresno). "Senator Clinton is the most qualified candidate in the race having tackled such critical issues as healthcare, education, job creation and a strong defense. Hillary Clinton is a positive change for our country and most especially for the Central Valley. I am proud and honored to offer my strong endorsement for Senator Hillary Clinton. "
Here at home, during my time in the Senate, I have cherished the opportunity to work with my women colleagues in both Houses and on both sides of the aisle. Now we may not see eye to eye on everything, but we get together and we trade those very important bits of advice like what kind of shoes to wear on marble floors when you're on your feet all day. And when it comes to the issues that we can agree on -- whether it's afterschool funding or healthcare and education for women here in America or for women in Afghanistan-- we are a force to be reckoned with.
From quality, affordable healthcare for every American to retirement security for every American. Paid leave. Flexible workplaces.
"I have been a big fan of Hillary's for a long time because she understands the issues that are important to me." said Christine Snively, a UNH graduate student who is expected to introduce Hillary at an event at the Durham campus. "She has strong plans to restore the Middle Class and provide universal healthcare to every American. Hillary also recognizes the importance of making college affordable and of promoting alternative means of education for kids who don't take the college route."
"I have been a big fan of Hillary's for a long time because she understands the issues that are important to me." said Christine Snively, a UNH graduate student who introduced Hillary at this afternoon's rally.

Hillary also recognizes the importance of making college affordable and of promoting alternative means of education for kids who don't take the college route."
Third, improving healthcare in Indian Country will be at the top of my national agenda. It is unacceptable that the average life expectancy for American Indians is nearly five years less than the rest of the population. It is unacceptable that Native Americans are more than four times as likely to die from diabetes and more than 50% more likely to die from pneumonia or influenza. It is unacceptable that while the federal government spends nearly $6,000 for each Medicare recipient -- it spends only $2,000 per person for Indian Health Service medical care.
When I'm President, Indian healthcare will be a national priority along with quality, affordable care for every single Native American family. I won't rest until I get it done.
Finally, on this observation of Veterans Day, I want you to know that as President, I will stand up for our veterans every day. As you know, Native Americans have one of the highest rates of service of any group in America. At the end of the twentieth century, we had nearly 200,000 Native American veterans in America. I believe one of the most fundamental obligations of the next President is to keep faith with these veterans -- to provide the healthcare and benefits they've earned and the respect and gratitude they deserve. So I'll fully fund the VA, I'll cut the red tape, I'll create a new GI Bill for a new generation of veterans. I will never back down and never stop fighting for those who fought for us.
9: At the Mount Cranmore Ski Resort in North Conway, Hillary sat down with 9 undecided New Hampshire voters over hot chocolate and discussed her energy policy, healthcare, Iraq and other important subjects.
"I was overwhelmed by what a dynamic speaker she was and she really address all the points that hit home for me, specifically healthcare...I was just overwhelmed."-Laura Fox, Bow (NH for Hillary Grassroots video interview)
"She's very down to earth. I like her plan, I like her plan for healthcare as well as her family plan...I'm sure she will be elected for our first woman President."-Patricia Giaquinto, Hooksett (NH for Hillary Grassroots video interview)
"I'm a first year grad student here at UNH I'm all for Hillary because I love all the plans that she has for healthcare, for college funding, I mean it is all relative to everyone...I know she is going to do it and that is why I'm here and I'm willing to do anything and everything to get her into office."-Nancy Gegbe, Durham (NH for Hillary Grassroots video interview)
"I support Senator Clinton because I feel that she has the most concise universal healthcare plan for this country and will improve our foreign relations and will get us back to the America that we are."-David Jacobson, President, UNH for Hillary, Durham (NH for Hillary Grassroots video interview)
Hillary: They have done their best for us, now we must do our best for them and give them the healthcare and compensation they have earned.
"As the President of the Hawkeye Labor Council and a member of the Cedar Rapids City Council, I know all too well that middle class Iowans are struggling with increasing costs, from home heating bills to healthcare.
Under my plan, you and your child will never be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions or risk factors. Parents will no longer be burdened by unmanageable premiums just because their children have autism. And when all Americans have regular healthcare, we'll be able to reach so many more children early on.
In her remarks today, Dr. Lynch cited Senator Clinton's bold, detailed plan to provide affordable and truly universal healthcare for every American. She also highlighted Senator Clinton's strong bipartisan record including her championing the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance(SCHIP) program; her efforts to expand TriCare benefits for members of the Guard and Reserve and their families; championing legislation for the critical testing of prescription drugs for children, and fighting for a sweeping overhaul of foster care and adoption out of foster care.
With 47 million Americans lacking health insurance, Hillary vowed to establish universal healthcare that includes quality, affordable coverage for every American.
"As the next President of the United States, Hillary will lead this nation in a direction of hope, change and prosperity," said Assemblymember Juan Arambula (D-Fresno).

"Her commitment to promoting policies to develop alternative energy technologies and fighting global warming are only two of the many issues in which Hillary has shown her ability to lead. Senator Clinton also has a long record of working on issues that are important to women and to Latino families, such as education, healthcare and economic empowerment. I look forward to working to help elect Hillary the next president of the United States."
So many of us grew up with that. You know, we were raised to believe that if you worked hard and if you played by rules you'd be able to build a better life for yourself and your family. Well, I don't think in the last six years our country has actually been living up to that basic bargain. The leadership here in Washington seems to ignore middle class and hardworking families across our country. Under this president's leadership household debt has soared, healthcare costs have skyrocketed, assuming that you have it. Wages have remained stagnant. Now corporate profits are up. And productivity is up, which means Americans are working harder than anybody in the world, but we're not getting rewarded. I'll tell you who is getting rewarded. Companies like Halliburton are getting rewarded with no-bid contracts, then they move their CEOs across the ocean to another country and leave us hanging right here at home.
You know, for six long years, our President has not seen the vast majority of Americans. Not our middle class, not our working families. He's looked right through them. To him, they're invisible. You know, if you're a child sitting in a crumbling school, you're invisible. If you're a small business owner who worries about energy costs or someone who can't afford to fill up your tank -- you're invisible. If you're a hardworking parent who needs affordable childcare while you go to work -- you're invisible. Even if you're a soldier returning from combat who needs healthcare and disability compensation, you are invisible. Well, those days are over.
Baldwin was elected to the House of Representatives in 1998, becoming the first woman to represent Wisconsin in Congress. She is a forceful advocate for creating a universal healthcare system for all Americans, and has worked to expand stem cell research and prescription drug benefits for seniors. Because of her expertise, the Clinton Campaign has asked Baldwin to serve on its Health Care Policy Task Force.
And I worked for four years with Senator Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, to provide access to Tricare for National Guard and Reserve members. When I got to the Senate I'm sure many people thought I would never talk to Lindsey Graham, let alone work with him, but I decided that we had a job to do and he in South Carolina and I in New York were seeing the same thingsâ€”that is, our National Guard and Reserve troops were being activated to go to Iraq or Afghanistan, many of them were considered medically unready because they were uninsured in their private civilian lives. They worked for employers who didn't provide insurance, they were self employed and couldn't afford it, they were young and didn't think that they had to really worry about their health but a thorough exam found problems. So Senator Graham and I said we're going to make sure that if you're a National Guard or Reserve member, you will have access to healthcare and you'll be part of this great American military from the very beginning. We will take care of you and your families.

"We face many complex policy challenges in this country and abroad. From healthcare to national security, Hillary 'gets it'. We have enormous respect for Hillary's forward-looking agenda in energy, innovation, healthcare and the economy. She has the experience, judgment and leadership to strengthen America's standing in the world. One of the greatest challenges facing Americans and the world is sound energy policy, particularly addressing global warming. Hillary will assemble a world-class team to tackle these incredibly important issues, and we are pleased to support her."
Americans in the twenty-two states that voted on Super Tuesday strongly reaffirmed their desire for a serious, substantive candidate who hears their voices and will deliver solutions to the challenges facing the country, especially the deteriorating economy and the healthcare crisis. It is Hillary Clinton who is seen as being both ready to be commander in chief on day one and is ready to deal with the big challenges we face as a nation.
Sen. McCain Will Run on National Security; Hillary Wins That Argument. When it came to national security, "strong and wrong" won out over "right and weak" in the 2002 and 2004 elections. With Hillary, that is not and will not be an issue: Based on what they know of her and her experience, voters believe Hillary is fully ready to be commander in chief. She will be strong and right. Voters know she has the right policies - ending the war in Iraq, re-establishing our relations with our allies - and they know she has the strength of leadership that America's next president will need in a world that can turn dangerous in an instant. As such, the Republicans will not be able to play the national security card against Hillary Clinton, like they are now doing against Senator Obama, and that makes her a fundamentally stronger candidate against John McCain. Case in point is what George Bush said on Sunday morning about Sen. Obama, "I certainly don't know what he believes in. The only foreign policy thing I remember he said was he's going to attack Pakistan and embrace Ahmadinejad." With Hillary, the Republicans' national security argument blunted and the election debate will shift to healthcare and the economy - areas of decisive strength for Hillary.
Hillary is the best candidate to take on Sen. McCain and defeat him. She has outperformed at the ballot box throughout her career. She will neutralize the argument on national security so the election will turn on her ability to manage our economy and reform healthcare. The GOP will not be able to increase her negatives in a way they can with an untested candidate. And Hillary's core voters - working class, women, Latinos, Catholics - are exactly the voters that comprise the key swing voters the party has needed in the past to win. This is an observation I made in the Washington Post after the 2004 election, "Middle-aged women and Hispanic voters were key voting blocs that made the difference, swinging the vote from Kerry to Bush. In fact, in 2004 women made up 54 percent of the U.S. electorate, the highest percentage in history. Their interest in and impact on politics has been increasing." (Washington Post, 3/21/2006)."
When I say solutions, I mean reigning in those corporate special interests and rebuilding the middle class. I have proposed $100 billion in middle class tax cuts, tax cuts that will go for healthcare, to make college affordable, for secure retirement. Part of the way we'll do that is to take away the $55 billion in tax cuts that have gone to those who, frankly, do not need your money more than you need your money. Explain to me how it can make any sense that we have a tax code that still gives tax benefits to companies that move jobs and profits out of Montana to foreign countries. We're going to end that. We're going to tell people the tax code of the United States will reflect the patriotic investment in jobs and businesses right here, in order to build a stronger economy. How is it fair that a Wall Street money manager making $50 million a year pays a lower percentage in taxes to our government than a nurse, a teacher, or a truck driver right here in Montana pays to that government of ours?
