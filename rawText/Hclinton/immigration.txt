And, you know, when we think about the legitimate concerns that people have about trade or immigration, those are problems to be solved. And that's what I think we should be focused on.
As first lady of Arkansas, first lady of the United States, a U.S. senator, secretary of state, and a presidential candidate, Hillary has not only supported progressive issues like civil rights, climate change, comprehensive immigration reform, reproductive rights, criminal justice reform, economic justice, and more—she's also put them front and center in the political debate.
"Recently, the debate over immigration, an issue that's very close to my heart, has been poisoned by some of the other people running. I am Haitian American. ... Watching the immigrant community be torn down over these past few months has been incredibly hurtful. But Hillary has been there every step of the way, making sure that everyone in this country is shown the respect they are owed."
"Hillary Clinton has a heart for service and has spent her entire career working to expand opportunities for all Americans. As a champion for women's rights, thoughtful diplomacy, criminal justice reform, commonsense immigration policies and a clean energy economy, she has proven that she is the most capable candidate to lead our country. The City of Atlanta needs a partner like Hillary Clinton in the White House to continue supporting investments in infrastructure, transportation solutions, and expanding economic opportunities for working families."
3 Right now, millions of families are waiting for SCOTUS to decide on @POTUS' executive actions on immigration. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016
Hailing the innovative ideas coming out of America's cities, Clinton pledged to partner with local leaders on deploying broadband technology, expanding home ownership and continuing the fight for comprehensive immigration reform and stronger border security.
The Senator also discussed her support for comprehensive immigration reform that includes strengthening America's borders, greater cooperation with our neighbors, strict but fair enforcement of our laws, federal assistance to state and local governments, strict penalties for those who exploit undocumented workers, and a path to earned legal status for those who are here, working hard, paying taxes, respecting the law, and willing to meet a high bar, including learning English. The solution must also protect the sanctity of families and repair the broken, unfair bureaucratic system that forces citizens and lawful immigrants to live apart from their spouses and children.
"Hillary Clinton has a plan to keep families together and has spoken out against large-scale raids. She will expand and protect the president's executive actions and has vowed to introduce comprehensive immigration reform in her first hundred days, while Trump has promised to conduct mass deportations and repeal the executive actions on DACA and DAPA."
"I believe Senator Hillary Clinton understands the importance of Fresno and the Central Valley as it pertains to the nation as a whole," said Cynthia Sterling, Fresno City Councilwoman. "Our area has the highest concentration of poverty and yet we are the place that feeds the world. Senator Clinton will be a champion for our area in bringing the necessary resources to sustain a healthy agriculture economy. As President, I know that Hillary Clinton will ensure that Fresno and the valley is foremost on her mind when it comes to such tough issues as immigration, high unemployment and affordable housing."
In its endorsement editorial the Kansas City Star wrote that Hillary 'is a woman of obvious intelligence with a strong commitment to reform on health care, taxes, energy, immigration, education and global warming."
In our view, however, Sen. Clinton would be the top choice for the Democratic nomination. She is a woman of obvious intelligence with a strong commitment to reform on health care, taxes, energy, immigration, education and global warming.
The 2004 election was determined by two key groups - women concerned about security and Latinos - and against Sen. McCain those groups could again prove decisive. President Bush won 40 percent of the Latino vote in 2004 and Sen. McCain, unlike other Republicans, has been supportive of immigration reform. These are two groups that enthusiastically support Hillary.
Washington, DC -- Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on President Bush to reconsider immigration proposals reportedly under consideration by the Bush Administration that would dramatically scale back the existing family visa system. The proposal reportedly would place caps and waiting periods on the parents of U.S. citizens applying for green cards, force all applicants who have been waiting in a family visa backlog to start again and pay a $500 fee, and create a point system that would deny visas to family members based on their education and skill levels. In a letter to President Bush, Senator Clinton emphasized that this immigration proposal would not only fail to help immigrant families, but would dramatically worsen the situation for families of hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens and lawful immigrants throughout the country.
Senator Clinton emphasized that we need to find a thoughtful and effective solution to our immigration crisis. Along with comprehensive reform of our immigration laws, we need to repair the broken parts of our immigration system that irrevocably damage families and force citizens and lawful immigrants to live apart from their spouses and children overseas. To help remedy this situation, Senator Clinton last year offered an amendment during consideration of immigration reform legislation that would have taken steps to protect the sanctity of families.
As you well know, our immigration system is in crisis, and we need to find a thoughtful and effective solution that combines a number of reforms. A comprehensive reform to our immigration laws must have, as essential ingredients, a strengthening of our borders, greater cross-cooperation with our neighbors, strict but fair enforcement of our laws, federal assistance to our state and local governments, strict penalties for those who exploit undocumented workers, and a path to earned legal status for those who are here, working hard, paying taxes, respecting the law, and willing to meet a high bar.
Along with these changes, it is imperative that we repair those broken portions of our immigration system that irrevocably damage families and force citizens and lawful immigrants to live apart from their spouses and children overseas. It is why last year I introduced an amendment during consideration of the immigration reform bill that would have taken steps to protect the sanctity of families. Our American values demand no less.
Therefore, I was extremely disappointed to learn that according to recent reports, your Administration is entertaining an immigration reform proposal that not only fails to help immigrant families, but would dramatically worsen the situation for the families of hundreds of thousands of United States citizens and lawful immigrants throughout our country. According to reports, your proposal would dramatically scale back the existing family visa system. For example, the reports indicate that your proposal would eliminate several of the existing family preference categories, a change that would make it impossible for U.S. citizens to sponsor many of their relatives for green cards. The proposal reportedly would also place caps and waiting periods on the parents of U.S. citizens applying for green cards, force all applicants who have been waiting in a family visa backlog to start again and pay a $500 fee, and create a point system that would deny visas to family members based on their schooling and skill levels. While we need to attract skilled workers to this country, we should not do so at the expense of our families and communities.
"As we consider reform to our current broken immigration system, we must address issues like family reunification. Under our current system, families are separated for long periods of time, sometimes decades. Last year, during the debate on the comprehensive immigration reform, I offered an amendment to address the backlog of family visas. I will continue to advocate for comprehensive immigration reform legislation that brings families together.
Rep. Clarke (Brooklyn, NY 11th CD) is in her first term in Congress after serving five years on the New York City Council representing Brooklyn.

Rep. Clark is dedicated to providing responsible governance for immigration reform, education, employment and economic development.
"Standing up for America's values and protecting our country and our people is the first job of the President. Bringing us together to end the war, fixing our economy, and taking on big challenges like immigration, health care, energy independence, climate change and so much else is what I will do.
"Hillary Clinton has a heart for service and has spent her entire career working to expand opportunities for all Americans," said Mayor Kasim Reed of Atlanta, GA. "As a champion for women's rights, thoughtful diplomacy, criminal justice reform, commonsense immigration policies and a clean energy economy, she has proven that she is the most capable candidate to lead our country. The City of Atlanta needs a partner like Hillary Clinton in the White House to continue supporting investments in infrastructure, transportation solutions, and expanding economic opportunities for working families. I wholeheartedly endorse her candidacy for President."
When Congress failed to pass both the DREAM Act and a comprehensive immigration reform bill, President Obama took executive action to let DREAMers (undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children) and parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents remain in the United States. These executive actions, known as DACA and DAPA, would keep millions of families together—and every leading Republican presidential candidate wants to end them.

Hillary supported comprehensive immigration reform legislation every time it came up for a vote during her time as a U.S. senator. She co-sponsored the DREAM Act three times. As president, Hillary will fix our broken immigration system—with or without help from Congress.
That starts with comprehensive immigration reform once and for all, with a path to full and equal citizenship that treats every person with dignity. But if Congress refuses to act, she'll defend President Obama's executive actions that provide relief from deportation for DREAMers and their parents, and she'll do everything possible under the law to protect immigrant families, including a system for parents of DREAMers and others who have contributed to this country to make their case and be eligible for deferred action.

  " She has long favored the kind of common-sense gun controls this city and country desperately need. She has been a champion of civil rights, women's issues and comprehensive immigration reform, including the creation of a pathway to citizenship. She opposes privatizing Social Security and believes working people should be guaranteed, by law, up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave."

  " Clinton has a long list of sound policy proposals, from aiming for a cure for Alzheimer's to campaign finance reform, climate change, early education, higher education, the economy, gun violence, immigration, racial justice, Social Security, veterans, workforce skills and more."
Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together. And it's the right thing to do.
Hillary also outlined her support for comprehensive immigration reform, pledging to secure our borders while providing an earned path to legal citizenship. And she would stand up against growing anti-immigrant sentiments and honor America's heritage and values as a nation of immigrants.

Washington, DC - Today's marches underscore the importance of comprehensive immigration reform. Our immigration system is broken, and it is past time that we came together and implemented an effective policy which respects our immigrant heritage, the rule of law, and human dignity. That is what I am committed to achieving.
Although many Republicans have tried to derail attempts at comprehensive immigration reform, I am committed to working with my colleagues to create an immigration system that respects our values. We must insist on comprehensive immigration reform that protects our homeland security and protects the dignity of millions of families who live here. There is a smart and effective, comprehensive solution to the impasse we face, and I will continue to pursue it.
Jackson Lee is in her seventh term in Congress, and is Co-Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus and a leading voice on immigration issues. Congressional Quarterly has named her one of the 50 most effective Members of Congress, and U.S. News and World Report called her one of the 10 most influential legislators in the House of Representatives.
Jackson Lee brings extensive experience on the issue of immigration reform, having served as the ranking member of the Immigration Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. As a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, Jackson Lee has considerable expertise in homeland, border, and national security issues. Additionally, as founder and Co-chair of the Children's Caucus, Jackson Lee will bring a wide range of fresh ideas to the campaign as it focuses on our nation's children.
"Many Americans, including we in the AAPI community, are ready for a change in leadership in the White House," said Hawaii State Senate President Colleen Hanabusa. "Hillary is ready to tackle the tough issues in this country that have been ignored for too long. From immigration to health care to our role in the world, Hillary will be able to lead this country from day one and help us reclaim the American Dream."
In the Senate, Hillary has championed numerous initiatives to improve the lives of AAPIs, their families and communities. Last year Hillary introduced legislation that would reunite families who have been separated by the immigration system. In addition, she sponsored the Legal Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act to restore access to Medicaid and SCHIP benefits for legal immigrant pregnant women and children and introduced the Access to Employment and English Language Acquisition Act to provide more job training funds for individuals with limited English language skills. As president, Hillary Clinton will promote an agenda that provides the opportunity, support and tools that AAPIs need to realize the American dream and address the challenges facing the community, including discrimination, language barriers, and poor access to affordable health care.
Washington, DC -- "This afternoon, a bipartisan group of Senators, who have been working closely in conjunction with the Administration, announced that they had reached an agreement on a comprehensive approach for reforming our broken immigration system.
"As I have long maintained, comprehensive immigration reform must have as essential ingredients a strengthening of our borders, greater cross-cooperation with our neighbors, strict but fair enforcement of our laws, federal assistance to our state and local governments, strict penalties for those who exploit undocumented workers, and a path to earned legal status for those who are here, working hard, paying taxes, respecting the law, and willing to meet a high bar. In particular, we must also ensure that any bill protects the sanctity of families and does not lead to the creation of a new underclass in our country.
"This amendment is about fundamental fairness. The families of legal permanent residents of this country who are playing by the rules should not be penalized because our current immigration system is paralyzed with backlogs," Senator Hagel said.
Sen. Robert Menendez said, "We are facing a fundamental change to the values of our immigration system. The bedrock principle of family would be drastically diminished under this deal. Passing this amendment would promote social stability and show that family values do not, in fact, end at the Rio Grande, as the president likes to say."
"Senator Clinton has consistently provided leadership on this issue. She has never lost sight of the real families and children impacted by our broken immigration system," said Reverend Luis Cortes, Founder and President of Esperanza, the largest Hispanic Evangelical organization. "Senator Clinton's amendment would help reunite families now torn apart because of an unfair policy, and I want to thank her for her courage and commitment to fixing this injustice."
In the poll, nearly two-thirds of Texans said the country was on the wrong track. Four in 10 called the Iraq war the nation's most important problem. One in 10 cited immigration.

"It is great to see a candidate focused on the AAPI vote," said Judy Chu, Vice Chair of California's State Board of Equalization and co-host of a house party in Pasadena, CA. "While many in our community are flourishing, AAPIs still face many challenges with respect to health care, civil rights, and immigration. Hillary has a plan to tackle those tough issues and we know that we'll always have an open door to her White House. That's why we're supporting her."
Hillary Clinton has spent 35 years fighting to expand access to high quality childcare, improve our schools, provide job training, and help students go to college, support people in purchasing homes and provide assistance to minority-owned businesses. As First Lady, she helped bring attention to key issues for Latinos by conveying the first ever White House Conference on Hispanic Education and the first ever White House Conference on Hispanic Children and Youth. Clinton has pledged to fight for comprehensive immigration reform and to continue making issues of concern to Latinos a high priority when she is President.
Hillary also outlined her support for comprehensive immigration reform, pledging to secure our borders while providing an earned path to legal citizenship. And she would stand up against growing anti-immigrant sentiments and honor America's heritage and values as a nation of immigrants.
"These are times of challenge, but also of opportunity for Hispanics in America. To be able to face the challenges ranging from access to health care and quality education to comprehensive immigration reform and ending the war in Iraq, Hispanics must be at the table when decisions are made.
"The AAPI community has an opportunity to make a real difference in this presidential election, especially in California," said Soo. "Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to address the issues facing our community including improving education, providing all Americans with quality, affordable health care, and finally fixing our broken immigration system."
Hillary Clinton will bring the leadership that the country needs to finally pass a comprehensive immigration reform policy. Our current system is broken. It is at odds with our values as a nation and is simply not working. There are more than 12 million undocumented people currently living in the United States - that's nearly 1 in 20 workers. We have no ability to identify them or ensure that they are being treated fairly in the workplace. Hillary will enact comprehensive reform that is fair. She will also work to help change the negative tone and rhetoric that has divided our nation when it comes to immigration. This reform will:
During her participation in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's Presidential Forum, Hillary detailed some of the initiatives contained in the Agenda. It includes ideas to improve the quality of education we provide to Latino children, to provide more pathways to economic success, to offer quality health care that is affordable, to increase the supply of affordable housing, to support our veterans, to ensure environmental justice, and to craft comprehensive immigration reform.
Comprehensive immigration reform: There are more than 12 million undocumented people currently living in the United States - that's nearly 1 in 20 workers - but we have no way to identify them or ensure that they are treated fairly in the workplace. She will provide a path to citizenship for those who have paid taxes and appropriate fines, learn English, have not committed crimes, and have been contributing members of our society. Hillary will also expand border security, maintain family reunification, create an agricultural guest worker program, eliminate the backlog of immigration applications, and capitalize on technological advances to streamline and expedite the system of entering the United States.
Why are Westerners so excited about Hillary Clinton? Because on the issues that matter to Western voters – like sensible immigration reform, environmental protection, alternative energy, Yucca Mountain, choice, health insurance for children, reducing the budget deficit and ending the Iraq war – Hillary is the only candidate with the experience and record of accomplishment to get the job done.

"Many would like nothing more than to contribute to the only country they've ever known as home. But for these children, because of their immigration status, they are often effectively barred from pursuing a post-secondary education and reaching their full potential. Through no fault of their own, they are forced to live in the shadows and denied their chance at achieving their God given potential.

Obama and Edwards haven't taken title to any issues with party voters in the three states, the poll shows, though Obama is close to Clinton on immigration and job creation. Unfortunately for the Illinois senator, neither concern is more than a blip for Democrats, with only one in 20 listing them atop the agenda.
At home, the new president will have to address the fact that comprehensive health insurance is now beyond the reach of an increasing number of Americans. The new president will have to redouble the country's commitment to veterans and their families, especially in light of the wave of wounded men and women returning home from Iraq. The new president will have to pursue an effective yet humane strategy to curb illegal immigration. The new president will need to restore an ideological balance on the Supreme Court, reflecting the wide range of beliefs in American society. The new president will have to ease the country toward energy independence, without killing off the economic engine that is the envy of the world. And the new president will need to reshape key regulatory agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that have become dangerous appendages of the industries they are supposed to govern.
Most Americans don't fully comprehend the complexities of the immigration problem, instead ceding to the notion that hordes of citizens from Mexico and Central American are sneaking across our border in the dark of night solely to steal our jobs and infect our schools with drugs and gangs.
On the Democratic side, one by one, the candidates - in a very centered and respectable manner - have laid out their points of views on Social Security, health care, the war in Iraq, and immigration. And as a general rule, we have noticed that the Democratic candidates think alike, and that even though they do share some differences, these differences are nothing like the ones between their Republican counterparts.
Strictly focusing on Hispanic-oriented issues, we have clearly and less pragmatically seen that Republicans will not offer practical solutions to problems like immigration and the war in Iraq.
Elected in 1996, Congressman Silvestre Reyes became the first Hispanic to represent the 16th District of Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives. In December 2006, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi selected Reyes to be Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, a committee on which Congressman Reyes has served since 2001. Prior to his election to Congress, Reyes served his country in Vietnam and then spent 26 years rising through the ranks of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service in the U.S. Border Patrol. He is a leader on intelligence, national security, immigration reform, and cross-border issues.
In its endorsement editorial the Kansas City Star wrote that Hillary 'is a woman of obvious intelligence with a strong commitment to reform on health care, taxes, energy, immigration, education and global warming."
In our view, however, Sen. Clinton would be the top choice for the Democratic nomination. She is a woman of obvious intelligence with a strong commitment to reform on health care, taxes, energy, immigration, education and global warming.
"After meeting with and talking to the candidates, the UFW board believes Hillary Clinton to be the strongest, most experienced candidate for President of the United States. She will be able to tackle our nation's toughest problems - health care, improving the economy for working people and repairing our country's standing in the world. Senator Clinton has stood with farm workers and immigrants - fighting for comprehensive immigration reform, sponsoring the UFW sponsored AgJOBS and helping 1,800 farm workers sign a union contract with D'Arrigo after 30 years," said UFW President Arturo Rodriguez.
The 2004 election was determined by two key groups - women concerned about security and Latinos - and against Sen. McCain those groups could again prove decisive. President Bush won 40 percent of the Latino vote in 2004 and Sen. McCain, unlike other Republicans, has been supportive of immigration reform. These are two groups that enthusiastically support Hillary.
You put so many difficult obstacles in the way here. You're going to ask people in motor vehicle departments to basically overlook the immigration laws of America. You're going to ask people to turn a blind eye and accept this form of identification.
And my supporters in California and in New York and across the country, Latino and others, understand exactly why this is the position we should be taking. And I intend to push for comprehensive immigration reform upon taking office as president.
That is why this editorial board has not hesitated in supporting a comprehensive immigration reform that favors millions of undocumented immigrants, and in facing some of these unjust, belligerent and racist measures and anti-immigrant laws.
"Latino families are concerned about our economy and the well-being of their families. Hillary Clinton has a plan to put our economy back on track, improve access to quality education for our nation's children and to support comprehensive immigration reform. She is the best choice for Rhode Island and our nation," said Mayor David Cicilline.
Congressman Bell is a strong advocate for health care reform, public school education and a passionate supporter of stem cell research. He has long fought for issues important to Texans, including comprehensive immigration reform and improving transportation.
"Throughout our 28-year career, we have never been involved in politics but we feel this election is the most important election in our lifetime," said Lead Vocalist Oscar De La Rosa. "We believe that Hillary's experience will help us pull out of our economic slump and feel she has a solid plan to solve the immigration issue, which is very close to our hearts. We do not have the luxury of inexperience in the White House for another eight years."
Recapping Yesterday: In Laredo, Texas, Hillary spoke to an "enthusiastic crowd" and "earned loud applause in calling for a comprehensive solution to... the immigration problem." One woman waited five hours at the rally site to present a rosary to Hillary... In Odessa, "they came early and stayed late to hear former President Bill Clinton." In San Angelo, his "event attracted people of every race, gender, and creed." When President Clinton recounted his wife's accomplishments, "each accomplishment garner(ed) a louder cheer."
FactCheck: Last night, Sen. Obama flip-flopped on normalizing trade relations with Cuba while his campaign distorted Hillary's record on comprehensive immigration reform. Get the facts here and here.
The lyrics of the song, as sung in Spanish (lyrics are below in English and Spanish), praises Clinton as the one candidate who can bring about the change Latino voters need to end the war in Iraq, achieve universal health care, bring about new and fair immigration laws, and better economic policies. The refrain is: "Hillary, Hillary Clinton, I will vote for her, for Clinton I will vote."
"With Hillary Clinton as president, Latinos know we will have a leader who understands our community and our needs," said Andy Andujar. "Latinos are concerned about the availability of jobs, access to funding for our businesses and a plan for comprehensive immigration reform. Hillary Clinton has the experience and foresight to make significant changes in America and we will work tirelessly to ensure she is our next president."
"I am honored to receive the endorsement of Mayor Cook and I was so touched to receive the key to the City of El Paso," Hillary Clinton said. "As president, I will continue listening to border communities to find real solutions on issues like health care and immigration."
The Clinton campaign today announced that Hillary Clinton would attend the Irish American Presidential Forum. The event is an opportunity for presidential candidates to address the Irish-American voters and answer questions important to the community, including Northern Ireland and immigration.

He'd have to deal with the fallout from this week's Washington Post report on his gross exaggeration of his role on immigration reform and housing policy.
"I continue to be appalled about the inappropriate and racially insensitive activities that took place within our nation's highest immigration enforcement entity, and am outraged that there was an effort to cover these incidents up. I have consistently called for a change of tone in the immigration debate and this incident points to the urgent need for that to happen. When the officials who are in charge of enforcing immigration laws display these kinds of prejudice, they become part of the problem instead of part of the solution. It's time for this Administration to hold its public servants accountable."
"I also disagree with Senator Obama's assertion that people in this country "cling to guns" and have certain attitudes about immigration or trade simply out of frustration. People of all walks of life hunt - and they enjoy doing so because it's an important part of their life, not because they are bitter.
"I would also point out that the vast majority of working Americans reject anti-immigration rhetoric. They want reform so that we remain a nation of immigrants, but also a nation of laws that we enforce and we enforce fairly.

And, you know, when we think about the legitimate concerns that people have about trade or immigration, those are problems to be solved. And that's what I think we should be focused on.
"During APA Heritage month we are reminded that we must fix our broken immigration system that is separating AAPI families. Last year, during the debate on comprehensive immigration reform, I offered an amendment to address the backlog of family visas. I will continue to advocate for comprehensive immigration reform legislation that brings families together."
"I salute the many Americans who have worked so hard in support of a comprehensive immigration reform that honors our history as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. As President, I am committed to working with Congress to introduce a comprehensive immigration reform bill within my first 100 days in office. I am also committed to continue working to end the demagoguery and divisiveness that has too often marked the immigration debate so that we can bring the American people together to achieve the reform we so badly need.
"Along with these changes, I believe we must repair those broken portions of our immigration system that irrevocably damage families and force citizens and lawful immigrants to live apart from their spouses and children overseas.
"Today's marches add to the urgency of passing comprehensive immigration reform that finally solves the problems of our broken system."
As president, I have four priorities for our hemisphere. First, my administration will work closely with our partners in the region to encourage effective democratic governance, the rule of law, and personal security for their citizens. Second, I am committed to helping to address the growing economic nequality within the nations of the Americas through expanded opportunity. Third, I will work with our neighbors to address the shared challenges of limate change and energy security. Fourth, I will work to enact comprehensive immigration reform that respects the rule of law, our immigrant heritage, and our values.
It's also essential that we strengthen families and communities and that's means we have to finally once and for all fix our immigration system. This is a family issue. It's an economic issue, too.
But it is at heart a family issue at. And if we claim that we are for families, we have to pull together and resolve the outstanding issues around our broken immigration system. The American people support comprehensive immigration reform, not just because it's the right thing to do, and it is, but because they know it strengthens families, strengthens our economy, and strengthens our country. That's why we can't wait any longer. We can't wait any longer for a path to fall and equal citizenship.
So, I will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship for you and for your family across our country. I will fight to stop partisan attacks on the executive actions that would put dreamers, including those with us today, at risk of deportation. And if Congress continues to refuse to act as president, I would do everything possible under the law to go even further.
The law currently allows for sympathetic cases to be reviewed but right now most of these cases have no way to get a real hearing. Therefore, we should put in place a simple, straightforward, accessible way for parents of dreamers and others with a history of service and contribution to their communities, to make their case and to be eligible for the same deferred action as their children. But that's just the beginning. There's much more to do to expand and enhance protections for families and communities to reform immigration and enforcement and detention practices, so they are more humane, targeted, and effective. And to keep building the pressure and support for comprehensive reform.
And then when I was Secretary of State, I was very pleased that there was bipartisan agreement in the Senate for comprehensive immigration reform. And it was such a good signal that Democrats and Republicans can work together, could solve a difficult problem, could put aside partisan differences. And the Senate passed it and the House of Representatives would never take it up.
And I think it would have passed if they had taken it up. But I think that they—the leadership in the House decided that politically they didn't want to do that because they had people who were strongly opposed to comprehensive immigration reform.
And as you point out in your family, you have a brother who is a U.S. citizen. So it's—we have a lot of these blended families and I want to do more to make sure that Doca and Dapa and all of the changes that have occurred continue and even expand. I would like to try to do more on behalf of the parents of dreamers who are not necessarily included. But the best way is to get the comprehensive immigration reform in our Congress and try to resolve all of this.
And because of it, I'm looking at pursuing a law degree. But, again, the system of immigration messes up my family. [inaudible] in our family.
That's why I have promoted, ever since, you know, we've been having this debate, going back to when I was in the senate, a comprehensive immigration reform program, similar to what the Senate passed on a bipartisan basis, where the people who have been here and people who have as your family has, you know, contributed and worked hard, you would have, you know, pay a fine. You'd probably, you know, we'd want you to learn English which is not a problem before anybody around this table. And we would, you know, want you to, you know, get in line to get a path to citizenship but you'd be no longer at risk of being deported and you would not have to leave the country for 3 to 10 years in order to be able to try to come back in.
Because it's now time for us to face reality. Our families need new solutions today, they need real help not promises. And I'm very clear about what I think needs to be done but I want to hear from all of you because what I'm doing in traveling around the country is taking ideas I have, some of which I have been developing for many years, but hearing from people on the front lines, whether its immigration or small business or today child care.
And I—I feel very bad and very disappointed with him and with the Republican Party for not responding immediately and saying: Enough. Stop it. But they are all in the—you know, in the same general area on immigration.
And I know it's not always how we think about this, but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform. [applause]
These days, there's not much daylight between Jeb Bush and his Republican colleagues when it comes to immigration. Since launching his presidential campaign, Bush has proven with his extreme, out-of-touch views that he'll do anything to outdo Donald Trump and Scott Walker.
"Hillary Clinton has a heart for service and has spent her entire career working to expand opportunities for all Americans," said Mayor Kasim Reed of Atlanta, GA. "As a champion for women's rights, thoughtful diplomacy, criminal justice reform, commonsense immigration policies and a clean energy economy, she has proven that she is the most capable candidate to lead our country. The City of Atlanta needs a partner like Hillary Clinton in the White House to continue supporting investments in infrastructure, transportation solutions, and expanding economic opportunities for working families. I wholeheartedly endorse her candidacy for President."
Donald Trump might be the face of anti-immigrant policies, but the truth is, there isn't much daylight between Trump and the other Republican candidates when it comes to immigration. In fact, none of the leading candidates have consistently supported a pathway to citizenship. And like Trump, they would even risk separating families by repealing President Obama's executive actions.
Recently, the debate over immigration, an issue that's very close to my heart, has been poisoned by some of the other people running. I am Haitian American. My parents and my family are immigrants from Haiti. Watching the immigrant community be torn down over these past few months has been incredibly hurtful. But Hillary has been there every step of the way, making sure that everyone in this country is shown the respect that they are owed, simply on the basis of their humanity. In person, Hillary's strength is undeniable, and while watching this speech I knew that she would stand up and fight for us on the full range of issues affecting our community, including the ones like immigration that people sometimes forget affect us too.
When the federal court put DAPA on hold, it was hard on Betsaida's family. For them, the immigration debate isn't just a sign of our country's political dysfunction—it's an emotional rollercoaster.
Question: Hello my question is if you become president will you support immigration reform?
Question: Mrs. Clinton, if you are elected president of the United States of America what political capital will you use to pass immigration reform or an executive action to help undocumented immigrants with family in this country?
She proudly highlighted our nation's immigrant heritage, and laid out her commitment to pass comprehensive immigration reform for those who come in search of a better life for themselves and their families. And she didn't mince words when calling out offensive Republican rhetoric.?
Comprehensive immigration reform could "add hundreds of billions of dollars to our GDP."
And in this term, the Supreme Court will also rule on the future of voting rights, women's health, affirmative action, and immigration. The fate of America's most fundamental rights may depend on the person (or people) our next president chooses.
"American workers built the greatest middle class in history by fighting for higher wages, safer working conditions, retirement security and the right to bargain collectively. The UFCW has been there every step of the way. They've fought to raise the minimum wage and reform our broken immigration system. They've stood strong to protect the rights and safety of workers across the country. And they've advocated for policies that would help working families get ahead, like paid sick days, fair scheduling and more full-time shifts.
"As president, getting incomes rising for working Americans will be my number-one priority. I'll stand up for workers and fight attacks on collective bargaining. I'll protect Social Security from Republican efforts to privatize it, and I'll fight to ensure more hardworking Americans can retire with dignity. I'll protect and build upon President Obama's executive actions on immigration and will work my hardest to achieve comprehensive immigration reform once and for all. And every day, I'll proudly stand with the men and women of UFCW to help working families get ahead and stay ahead."
Leadership Council members share Clinton's commitment to raising wages for the middle class, strengthening our nation's infrastructure to create good-paying jobs, defending and enhancing the Affordable Care Act, ensuring that cost is not a barrier for students going to college, reforming our broken immigration system and much more. You can learn more about Clinton's agenda.
When Congress failed to pass both the DREAM Act and a comprehensive immigration reform bill, President Obama took executive action to let DREAMers (undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children) and parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents remain in the United States. These executive actions, known as DACA and DAPA, would keep millions of families together—and every leading Republican presidential candidate wants to end them.

Hillary supported comprehensive immigration reform legislation every time it came up for a vote during her time as a U.S. senator. She co-sponsored the DREAM Act three times. As president, Hillary will fix our broken immigration system—with or without help from Congress.
That starts with comprehensive immigration reform once and for all, with a path to full and equal citizenship that treats every person with dignity. But if Congress refuses to act, she'll defend President Obama's executive actions that provide relief from deportation for DREAMers and their parents, and she'll do everything possible under the law to protect immigrant families, including a system for parents of DREAMers and others who have contributed to this country to make their case and be eligible for deferred action.
"President Obama's executive actions on immigration are an exercise of long-standing executive authority, and the Supreme Court should uphold them. The stakes for families couldn't be higher. As President, I will implement DAPA and DACA, expand on these efforts to provide relief to more families, and continue to fight for comprehensive immigration reform."
As first lady of Arkansas, first lady of the United States, a U.S. senator, secretary of state, and a presidential candidate, Hillary has not only supported progressive issues like civil rights, climate change, comprehensive immigration reform, reproductive rights, criminal justice reform, economic justice, and more—she's also put them front and center in the political debate.
"Recently, the debate over immigration, an issue that's very close to my heart, has been poisoned by some of the other people running. I am Haitian American. ... Watching the immigrant community be torn down over these past few months has been incredibly hurtful. But Hillary has been there every step of the way, making sure that everyone in this country is shown the respect they are owed."

  When they're all fighting over who's closest to your immigration position... #GOPDebate pic.twitter.com/Wt3a9nmz4D— The Briefing (@TheBriefing2016) January 29, 2016

Fixing our broken immigration system:
"If we really want to strengthen families, then we have to finally, once and for all, fix our broken immigration system."
3 Right now, millions of families are waiting for SCOTUS to decide on @POTUS' executive actions on immigration. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016
Hillary is committed to fighting for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full and equal citizenship ...

She has a plan on gun laws that's like none other.
Unapologetically she speaks out about the NRA and issues of color.
Her plan for immigration is to keep families together.
She'll end family detention and close private immigration shelters.
Hillary Clinton has vowed to make immigration reform a top priority as president—and last week, she pledged to repeal a law that is tearing immigrant families apart. 
"I have always been proud to stand with the Latino community not only in fighting for comprehensive immigration reform, but fighting for all families to have the chance to get ahead and stay ahead. As a Senator, I was proud to vote for Ted Kennedy's immigration reform bill in 2007 and to co-sponsor the DREAM Act in 2003. As President, not only will I protect President Obama's executive orders and look to go further, but I will fight for comprehensive immigration reform legislation from the moment I take office. While immigration reform is vital for our families, our economy, and our future, it's not the only issue where the Latino community needs progress. Nearly half of Latinos live in counties that don't meet EPA air quality standards. Latinos between 25 and 29 are less than half as likely to have a bachelor's degree as whites. Latinas working full time make just 54 cents for every dollar a white man earns. We need equal pay for women, environmental justice for families, and good schools in every ZIP code for our kids.
Hillary—who has been a fierce advocate for workers' rights and comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship—thanked her for sharing her story.

  " She has long favored the kind of common-sense gun controls this city and country desperately need. She has been a champion of civil rights, women's issues and comprehensive immigration reform, including the creation of a pathway to citizenship. She opposes privatizing Social Security and believes working people should be guaranteed, by law, up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave."

  " Clinton has a long list of sound policy proposals, from aiming for a cure for Alzheimer's to campaign finance reform, climate change, early education, higher education, the economy, gun violence, immigration, racial justice, Social Security, veterans, workforce skills and more."

  " In 1995, the year I was born, Hillary Clinton made a revolutionary speech, proclaiming "women's rights are human rights". I heard it many years later, but it has inspired me every day since then to keep reaching higher. Hillary is a role model and an icon, who I know has inspired thousands of women like myself. As someone growing up with health problems, quality health care is important to me. Hillary is the only candidate I trust to improve our health care system. Now I'm navigating my way through college (and soon law school, like Hillary!), and I believe wholeheartedly in her plan to improve student debt. Her policies on gun safety, reproductive rights, climate change, education, immigration, her economics initiatives, and so much more made the choice to support her easy. I am happy to fight every day to elect Hillary Clinton, because I know she will fight for not only me, but this entire nation."
It's time to reform our broken immigration system.
This week in Arizona—a state that is home to some of the harshest anti-immigrant laws in the nation—Hillary once again pledged to make comprehensive immigration reform a top priority as president, and to do everything possible to keep families together.
"As President, I will fight alongside the AAPI community to at last pass comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full and equal citizenship. Still today, applicants from the Asia-Pacific region make up about 40 percent of the family visa backlog, and too many have waited decades to have the chance to be back with their families. Millions of people are eligible to become citizens and deserve the opportunity, but face real barriers to taking those last steps to naturalization. We can and we must address these challenges.
"It is why I co-sponsored legislation to protect DREAMers throughout my time in the senate as well as legislation to enact comprehensive immigration reform, and it is why I will do everything in my power as president to protect President Obama's executive actions, go further to provide relief for families, and introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office."
"I believe we are stronger together. When we embrace immigrants, not denigrate them. When we build bridges, not walls. That is why, as president, I will continue to defend DAPA and DACA, and do everything possible under the law to go further to protect families. It is also why I will introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship within my first 100 days. Because when families are strong—America is strong."
Jackson Lee is in her seventh term in Congress, and is Co-Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus and a leading voice on immigration issues. Congressional Quarterly has named her one of the 50 most effective Members of Congress, and U.S. News and World Report called her one of the 10 most influential legislators in the House of Representatives.
Jackson Lee brings extensive experience on the issue of immigration reform, having served as the ranking member of the Immigration Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. As a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, Jackson Lee has considerable expertise in homeland, border, and national security issues. Additionally, as founder and Co-chair of the Children's Caucus, Jackson Lee will bring a wide range of fresh ideas to the campaign as it focuses on our nation's children.
"Many Americans, including we in the AAPI community, are ready for a change in leadership in the White House," said Hawaii State Senate President Colleen Hanabusa. "Hillary is ready to tackle the tough issues in this country that have been ignored for too long. From immigration to health care to our role in the world, Hillary will be able to lead this country from day one and help us reclaim the American Dream."
In the Senate, Hillary has championed numerous initiatives to improve the lives of AAPIs, their families and communities. Last year Hillary introduced legislation that would reunite families who have been separated by the immigration system. In addition, she sponsored the Legal Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act to restore access to Medicaid and SCHIP benefits for legal immigrant pregnant women and children and introduced the Access to Employment and English Language Acquisition Act to provide more job training funds for individuals with limited English language skills. As president, Hillary Clinton will promote an agenda that provides the opportunity, support and tools that AAPIs need to realize the American dream and address the challenges facing the community, including discrimination, language barriers, and poor access to affordable health care.
Elected in 1996, Congressman Silvestre Reyes became the first Hispanic to represent the 16th District of Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives. In December 2006, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi selected Reyes to be Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, a committee on which Congressman Reyes has served since 2001. Prior to his election to Congress, Reyes served his country in Vietnam and then spent 26 years rising through the ranks of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service in the U.S. Border Patrol. He is a leader on intelligence, national security, immigration reform, and cross-border issues.
The 2004 election was determined by two key groups - women concerned about security and Latinos - and against Sen. McCain those groups could again prove decisive. President Bush won 40 percent of the Latino vote in 2004 and Sen. McCain, unlike other Republicans, has been supportive of immigration reform. These are two groups that enthusiastically support Hillary.
You put so many difficult obstacles in the way here. You're going to ask people in motor vehicle departments to basically overlook the immigration laws of America. You're going to ask people to turn a blind eye and accept this form of identification.
And my supporters in California and in New York and across the country, Latino and others, understand exactly why this is the position we should be taking. And I intend to push for comprehensive immigration reform upon taking office as president.
And, you know, when we think about the legitimate concerns that people have about trade or immigration, those are problems to be solved. And that's what I think we should be focused on.
And I know it's not always how we think about this, but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform. [applause]
