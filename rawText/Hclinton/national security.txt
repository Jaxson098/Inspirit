He says with national security secrets running through it. He says Russians, Chinese, even 18-year-olds could have hacked into your server.
And it is hard to take seriously senators who talk tough but then hold up key national security nominations, including the top official at the Treasury Department responsible for disrupting terrorist financing.
And I want to say in this public setting that when I'm in the White House I'm going to be there for you whenever you need me on whatever you need me for. Because there isn't anything more important to me than taking care of our first responders. It is part of our national security; it is part of our moral obligation.
But some people still don't get it. You know they say that collective bargaining will undermine our national security. They think you haven't earned the right to organize. You know what I say to them? I say, "Would you change places? Would you go into that fire? Would you stand on those collapsing floors and under those crumbling ceilings? Well the way I see it, when you plunge head first into burning buildings for a living, you have more than earned the right to organize for better conditions on the job."
This will be my first and most important mission as President -- one I believe I have the strength and experience to complete. Today, I want to lay out my three point plan for how I would achieve this -- how, as President, I would bring our troops home, work to bring stability to the region, and replace a military force with a new diplomatic initiative to engage countries around the world in securing Iraq's future and America's national security interests.
Now, will any of this be easy? Of course not. It's going to take tremendous discipline, patience and hard work. But I believe it can be done. I believe we can be a lot smarter about getting out of this war than we were about getting into it. The future of our national security and international standing depends upon it. And we owe our troops -- and their families -- nothing less.
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Tauscher has taken an active role in foreign policy and national security. She has traveled to the Middle East five times since the start of the Iraq war, including three trips to Iraq, and has visited troops and foreign leaders in Afghanistan and other Central Asian countries while serving in Congress.
Your mission says it all. Honor the dead by helping the livingâ€”through veteran services, community services, national security, and a strong national defense. But we have to begin with clear -eyed understanding of the new challenges and threats we face in the 21st century. From my service on the Senate Armed Services Committee, to my time as a First Lady and Senator, I have been privileged to travel to more than 80 countries representing America.
So when I'm President I will call upon our people to come together to support our veterans, in large ways as well as those small important kindnesses and recognition that can mean so much. Whether it's offering a job, or inviting someone to your child's school to speak, or saying a simple thank you line at church or in the line at the grocery store. We owe them everything and that means confronting our national security challenges with courage, strength and wisdom.
As voters look to the future, they will be looking at who can put the country on the right path and who can defend it against future threats. While Hillary is seen as strong on defense and has served on the Armed Services Committee, Sen. Obama has limited experience on these national security issues that would again be front and center.
So if Sen. McCain is the nominee, Hillary is the one well-positioned to beat him. Already well vetted, she is ready to stand up to Sen. McCain on national security and put together a winning coalition of voters that will take back the White House.

"She has done her homework on national security and I know from my personal discussions with her and with many other friends that go in and brief her in her role in the Senate Armed Services Committee. She knows the facts, she knows the details, plus she has the big picture. She is a strategic thinker but she has the building blocks of the strategy in her personal knowledge. This is someone that when she is president our military is going to respect very highly, and when our Senior Officers brief her and meet with her they are going be very, very impressed by what she knows and the intelligence that she brings to these problems."
Brigadier General John Watkins, Jr.
More than thirty former admirals and generals, including two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and five retired officers at the four-star rank have endorsed Hillary Clinton to be our next Commander-in-Chief. Eighteen of these esteemed flag and general officers and other senior national security officials took part in a rare conference call with reporters earlier this month; eleven met in person with Senator Clinton last week in Washington for a private conversation about ending the war in Iraq and winning the war in Afghanistan; and to testify publicly for her leadership ability. In these testimonials below, these great Americans who have given so much to our country, say why they believe Senator Clinton is the best candidate of either party to be our next Commander-in-Chief.

Restoring a strong, vibrant manufacturing sector in America and Indiana by implementing a 21st Century manufacturing strategy that includes investing in innovation and efficiency; protecting defense-related manufacturing jobs to help ensure America's national security; expanding the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, which already assists more than 300 small and mid-sized Hoosier companies; and standing up for unions by working to pass the Employee Free Choice Act.
At a speech in Indianapolis today, Hillary Clinton outlined a plan to maintain a strong national security and keep good jobs in the U.S. Her plan will invest in a new generation of defense manufacturing jobs and research and development to maintain America's competitiveness, innovative edge, and to provide our military and our soldiers with the equipment and technology they need. Hillary's plan is in response to the growing trend of defense manufacturing jobs leaving the U.S., and with them critical technology and know-how to keep our country safe. Hillary believes that America must maintain and strengthen its capacity to produce key defense technologies to have a strong economy and strong national security.
Hillary's plan includes five major parts - launching a comprehensive review of the defense industrial base in the first 100 days, a new critical capabilities impact analysis for federal contracts, a requirement to review foreign investment in critical national security industries and technologies, protecting "Buy America" provisions for metals that are vital to national security, and a new inter-agency task force to combat industrial espionage.
Hillary Clinton believes a strong defense industrial base is one of the foundations of the U.S. economy and is essential to ensuring our technological edge and safeguarding national security. Defense manufacturing also provides good, high-paying jobs for workers in Indiana and across the country. Below is a full outline of her plan:
2. A New Critical Capabilities Impact Analysis for Federal Contracts. It is vitally important for the United States to maintain its capacity to produce domestically what we need to protect our national security interests. Our defense manufacturing industry not only provides vital jobs and economic benefits to communities across Indiana and the United States but ensures that we maintain the technology and know-how to keep our citizens safe. Under current procurement rules, the Department of Defense is not allowed to consider the impact on American jobs our national security technological capacity. As a result there is often little reliable independent information on the impact of these contracting decisions, which can affect entire communities and the security of our economy. As President, Senator Clinton would require that an independent, third-party to work with bidders on defense contracts to conduct an impact analysis on critical capabilities - including U.S. jobs - so that the Department of Defense, Congress and other interested parties have a full and complete picture of the impact of procurement decisions. This new analysis will help ensure that we maintain an independent, competitive procurement process that is in the best interest of our country and our workers.
3. New Public Periodic Review Requirement of Foreign Investments in Critical National Security Industries and Technologies. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) plays an important role in ensuring that technologies and industries critical to U.S. national security are not sold off and outsourced to foreign governments. Senator Clinton has been an outspoken proponent of strengthening CFIUS and supported the 2007 legislation that was signed into law to increase oversight and transparency in the CFIUS process. However, despite these improvements, there is no mechanism currently in place to review CFIUS decisions once they are made. The story of Magnaquench highlights how important it can be to review foreign investments in key U.S. industries, to ensure that foreign investors and foreign governments are sticking to the terms of the agreements they made. That's why today, Senator Clinton called for requiring new periodic public reviews of CFIUS decisions on mergers, acquisitions, and agreements. These reviews will ensure that approved mergers have not changed in a manner that would be harmful to our national security interests. She will require that all periodic reports are published in the Federal Register so they are accessible to the public.
4. Protecting "Buy America" Provisions for Metals that are Vital to Our National Security. The United States must ensure that it maintains a secure source for the metals that are used to build out aircraft, ships and weaponry. We cannot afford to have our national security hinge on whether we can secure key inputs from other countries like China, which have shown a clear willingness to break and bend trade rules. Last year, Senator Bayh led an effort in Congress to strengthen the "specialty metals clause" which requires that certain vital metals used in defense manufacturing must be produced here in the United States. This provision helps ensure we maintain our independence and security, and that we maintain good, high-paying defense manufacturing jobs in Indiana and across the country. However, the Bush Administration and John McCain have made clear that they want to eviscerate this key provision. As President, Hillary will work to protect and strengthen the specialty metal clause to help ensure a strong, independent defense manufacturing base in America.
Our nation has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy and national security. Not that we always agree — far from it — but we do come together when it counts.

Our nation has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy and national security. Not that we always agree—far from it—but we do come together when it counts.
One the final language of the treaty itself, which I don't think went far enough to meet the test that I've always applied to any trade agreement—I have voted for them and I have voted against them when I was a senator—does it help to create more good paying jobs in America? Does it raise incomes, does it advance our national security?
And it is hard to take seriously senators who talk tough but then hold up key national security nominations, including the top official at the Treasury Department responsible for disrupting terrorist financing.
This is not how presidents behave. We can't afford to have a Commander-in-Chief who has no understanding of foreign policy, who has no coherent agenda, and who wants to go to war every time someone says a mean thing about him. As Hillary Clinton said yesterday, Donald Trump is simply not qualified for the job he seeks. This is not about ideology -- it's about responsible leadership. Anyone who is serious about our national security, regardless of their party, should not stand with Donald Trump."
As Secretary of State, Senator and First Lady, I had the honor of representing America abroad and helping shape our foreign policy at home. As a candidate for President, there's nothing I take more seriously than our national security. I've offered clear strategies for how to defeat ISIS, strengthen our alliances, and make sure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. And I'm going to keep America's security at the heart of my campaign.
"Just one day after we learned about Trump's hundreds of millions of dollars in undisclosed Russian business interests, this report suggests Page met with a sanctioned top Russian official to discuss the possibility of ending U.S. sanctions against Russia under a Trump presidency – an action that could directly enrich both Trump and Page while undermining American interests. This is precisely what more than fifty national security experts warned against when they called on Trump to disclose and divest his conflict-laden foreign assets that could endanger our national security.
So as I said in the beginning, we have two different visions here. I believe we are stronger together. That is at the core of what I've done over my years in advocacy and public service. I believe that America is already great, and it is our responsibility to make it even greater. I believe that as we make our economy work for everyone, we also need to keep our country safe, and we need to provide strong, steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners. I've laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues. I've laid out my plan for defeating and destroying ISIS. And what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent. It's unclear exactly what he is saying.
So today, I want to talk about our national security. Because when the election is over and people wake up on November 9th, we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all these weighty decisions. And that should really convince anyone how high the stakes really are in this election. And I just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next President: Can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally life and death decisions about war and peace? How do you handle a crisis? And do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries?

That's what I did for eight years as a senator. I never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed. And I think it's important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that. Because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted. They happen. I'll tell you a quick story. It was after President-elect Obama asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration. And I got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the White House in the Situation Room. And the new Obama national security team was on one side of table, and the outgoing Bush national security team was on the other side. And the Bush Administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration.

When you step back and take it all in, it's no surprise that 50 Republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying that they will not vote for Donald Trump, because he would be – in their words – 'the most reckless President in American history.' It's no surprise that not a single former President, Secretary of State or Defense, or National Security Advisor from either party has endorsed him. It's no surprise that Bob Gates, who served eight presidents over 50 years, Democrats and Republicans alike, has said Trump is, and I quote, 'beyond repair… stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government… temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform… unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief.'

The coalition building efforts during the first Gulf War and affecting the former Yugoslavia demonstrate that sustained political and diplomatic efforts are critical to establishing and maintaining U.S. national security interests. What worked for the first Bush administration and the Clinton administration has been abandoned or executed poorly. It is not a matter of partisanship; it is a matter of learning from lessons of successful American statesmanship of both Democratic and Republican presidents.
Among the most important reasons for extricating ourselves from Iraq are the looming challenges in the region and around the world to our national security. There is a global threat of terrorism and we have to confront it. Here, too, the policies of the Bush Administration have set us back.
Al-Zawahri, Osama bin Laden's second-in-command, the architect of many of the attacks on our country, throughout Europe and the world has said over and over again if we would only pay attention â€“ it is on their websites â€“ that torture helps the cause of extremism, watering the seeds of jihad. I've called for the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay because it represents in the eyes of the world abuse, secrecy, and contempt for the rule of law. Rather than keeping us more secure, Guantanamo is harming our national security. It compromises our long-term military and strategic interests and impairs our standing overseas.
And, of course, there's global warming, a particular challenge that has security implications. Eleven retired three- and four-star admirals [and generals], including General Zinni, had come out with a report entitled, "National Security and the Threat of Climate Change." It concluded that global warming did present a serious national security threat because of its projected impacts on reduced access to fresh water and impaired food production, the displacement of populations, the mass migrations that will occur, the failed states, the conflicts over scarce resources.
Your mission says it all. Honor the dead by helping the livingâ€”through veteran services, community services, national security, and a strong national defense. But we have to begin with clear -eyed understanding of the new challenges and threats we face in the 21st century. From my service on the Senate Armed Services Committee, to my time as a First Lady and Senator, I have been privileged to travel to more than 80 countries representing America.
So when I'm President I will call upon our people to come together to support our veterans, in large ways as well as those small important kindnesses and recognition that can mean so much. Whether it's offering a job, or inviting someone to your child's school to speak, or saying a simple thank you line at church or in the line at the grocery store. We owe them everything and that means confronting our national security challenges with courage, strength and wisdom.
And it is hard to take seriously senators who talk tough but then hold up key national security nominations, including the top official at the Treasury Department responsible for disrupting terrorist financing.
And when it comes to foreign policy and national security, well, I think we have a lot to do to keep our country safe, and I have some ideas that I've been putting out based on what I did in the Senate after 9/11, based on my work as secretary of State.
When I started running for president, I didn't know that some of the issues I've been talking about would end up front and center in my campaign. I knew I'd present my vision for where our economy should be in the 21st century. I knew we'd talk about national security, about how we can build on and improve the Affordable Care Act, and about my proposals to support small businesses, raise wages, and create good-paying jobs.
Now, the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security.
So as I said in the beginning, we have two different visions here. I believe we are stronger together. That is at the core of what I've done over my years in advocacy and public service. I believe that America is already great, and it is our responsibility to make it even greater. I believe that as we make our economy work for everyone, we also need to keep our country safe, and we need to provide strong, steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners. I've laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues. I've laid out my plan for defeating and destroying ISIS. And what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent. It's unclear exactly what he is saying.
When I was at Kent State talking about the threats that Donald Trump poses to our national security, I was really struck. It was a very big crowd, and it was primarily students. And I thought to myself, well, I'm not going to give a rah-rah speech because I really want to talk about what this means to national security. And I was introduced by a gentleman named Bruce Blair, a former Air Force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys. A launch officer. And he came out for me, along with now more than 30 launch officers, and basically they said, we cannot support Donald Trump because he should never, ever be near the nuclear codes and keys.
And I want to say in this public setting that when I'm in the White House I'm going to be there for you whenever you need me on whatever you need me for. Because there isn't anything more important to me than taking care of our first responders. It is part of our national security; it is part of our moral obligation.
But some people still don't get it. You know they say that collective bargaining will undermine our national security. They think you haven't earned the right to organize. You know what I say to them? I say, "Would you change places? Would you go into that fire? Would you stand on those collapsing floors and under those crumbling ceilings? Well the way I see it, when you plunge head first into burning buildings for a living, you have more than earned the right to organize for better conditions on the job."
"I am proud to endorse Senator Hillary Clinton's candidacy for President of the United States," Baldwin said. "Senator Clinton is supremely prepared and the candidate best able to ensure health care for all, reaffirm our commitment to the Constitution and rule of law, and re-establish our position of leadership in the world. She will be firm in protecting our national security and fair in addressing the aspirations and needs of all Americans. Hillary Clinton has been my friend and ally in the battle for health care for many years and I look forward to working with her to achieve our common goals when she becomes our next President," Baldwin said.

Now middle class families always end up drawing the short straw. Growth, according to this Republican philosophy, has to be unequal and government can't help. Instead, the Bush Administration gives no-bid contracts to political allies, allows no competition for senior citizens' drug prices under Medicare, and assumes no accountability for outsourcing national security responsibilities to contractors like Blackwater. They won't spend money to help working families get health insurance for their kids, but think nothing of giving health care providers billions more to take Medicare patients off the rolls.
Jackson Lee brings extensive experience on the issue of immigration reform, having served as the ranking member of the Immigration Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. As a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, Jackson Lee has considerable expertise in homeland, border, and national security issues. Additionally, as founder and Co-chair of the Children's Caucus, Jackson Lee will bring a wide range of fresh ideas to the campaign as it focuses on our nation's children.
Congresswoman Matsui was elected to Congress in 2005 to represent Sacramento and its surrounding areas. She replaced her husband, the late Congressman Robert Matsui. During her first week in Congress, Congresswoman Matsui signed on as a co-sponsor of bipartisan legislation to expand the number of stem cell lines available for vital medical research. Since lending her support to that first bill, she has worked to bring Sacramento's voice to legislation focusing on reducing prescription drug prices, expanding access to affordable health care, balancing national security needs with civil liberties, and implementing good government policies.
In a major display of momentum one day before the Nevada caucuses, Hillary Clinton today received the endorsement of Congressman Silvestre Reyes of Texas, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Congressman Reyes is one of the Democratic Party's leading voices on national security and U.S.-Mexico border issues. He will serve as the Clinton Campaign's Co-Chair for the Southwest Region.
Elected in 1996, Congressman Silvestre Reyes became the first Hispanic to represent the 16th District of Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives. In December 2006, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi selected Reyes to be Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, a committee on which Congressman Reyes has served since 2001. Prior to his election to Congress, Reyes served his country in Vietnam and then spent 26 years rising through the ranks of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service in the U.S. Border Patrol. He is a leader on intelligence, national security, immigration reform, and cross-border issues.
"Congressman Reyes is one of our wisest and most experienced leaders on national security and the particular issues that affect Americans living along the border and throughout the Southwest. I am proud to have his support and grateful for his advice," Senator Clinton said. "This endorsement is another sign of our growing momentum as we head into the Nevada caucuses."
As voters look to the future, they will be looking at who can put the country on the right path and who can defend it against future threats. While Hillary is seen as strong on defense and has served on the Armed Services Committee, Sen. Obama has limited experience on these national security issues that would again be front and center.
So if Sen. McCain is the nominee, Hillary is the one well-positioned to beat him. Already well vetted, she is ready to stand up to Sen. McCain on national security and put together a winning coalition of voters that will take back the White House.
So we do need to set a high bar for trade agreements. We should support them if they create jobs, raise wages and advance our national security. And we should be prepared to walk away if they don't. To create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more Americans.
And when it comes to foreign policy and national security, well, I think we have a lot to do to keep our country safe, and I have some ideas that I've been putting out based on what I did in the Senate after 9/11, based on my work as secretary of State.
Every single day, our feet sink deeper into the sands. Every day the crisis worsens. To hide from this debate with our troops in such danger is wrong, plain and simple. The crisis in Iraq has fostered a crisis of democracy here at home. The American people expect a debate. Our troops are owed a debate. And our constitution commands that we debate. But a partisan minority, acting at the behest of the Administration, is standing in the way. This amounts to a gag rule on our democracy, contrary to the national security interests of the United States.
You know, our troops understand we are debating this war. We're debating it not just in this chamber; we're debating it in kitchen table conversations and around water coolers and standing in line at supermarkets. We're debating this war everywhere Americans gather. Indeed, our troops are debating this war, and the American people understand that it is the policy that undermines our national security and interests, not a vote disapproving the policy.
In confronting enemies and threats, we are fortunate to possess a great many assets, all of which we must wisely deploy, including our military, diplomatic, economic, and cultural assets. Our strongest asset remains the democracy that we are privileged to take part in as members of the Senate and as representatives of our constituents. Our democratic institutions, under our Constitution, balance one another and check against excesses and concentrations of power that help us wrestle with difficult challenges in an open and forthright way. This constitutional framework is not an obstacle to pursuing our national security, but the example that we should project to the world. Our democracy, with its tradition of accountable power and open debate, is America at its best. And that's what we need, America at our best, as we deliberately and resolutely confront the threat posed by the Iranian regime.
So we have a lot to sort out here. We have all learned lessons from the conflict in Iraq, and we have to apply those lessons to any allegations that are being raised about Iran. Because, Mr. President, what we are hearing has too familiar a ring and we must be on guard that we never again make decisions on the basis of intelligence that turns out to be faulty. If we find evidence of potential Iranian complicity, we will take appropriate action, but that requires a partnership to defend and protect America's national security interests between the Congress and the President.
Now look, I think this is pretty straightforward. We can continue to allow our energy needs to hamstring our national security, continue to weather the oil price shocks that undermine our economy, and continue to ignore the global warming that threatens our future, or we can take a very different path. Someone I truly admire once said that "there's nothing that's wrong with America that can't be fixed by what's right with America." I totally agree. The energy problem affects every single one of us, and it will need every single one of us to solve it. But you know what? I'm confident we will. Together we're going to transform this country from energy dependence to energy independence, and turn global warming into what I believe will be a historic global renewal. And please, let's keep the conversation going.
And I want to say in this public setting that when I'm in the White House I'm going to be there for you whenever you need me on whatever you need me for. Because there isn't anything more important to me than taking care of our first responders. It is part of our national security; it is part of our moral obligation.
But some people still don't get it. You know they say that collective bargaining will undermine our national security. They think you haven't earned the right to organize. You know what I say to them? I say, "Would you change places? Would you go into that fire? Would you stand on those collapsing floors and under those crumbling ceilings? Well the way I see it, when you plunge head first into burning buildings for a living, you have more than earned the right to organize for better conditions on the job."

"On questions of foreign policy and national security, Senator Clinton will lead this country with both strength and experience," said Tom Loftus, former Speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly and Ambassador to Norway. "She showed that in the first debate, she has shown that in the U.S. Senate, and I saw her demonstrate that when she met with leaders from other countries during the Clinton Administration. Senator Clinton has represented all of the people of New York--including its dairy industry--effectively and forcefully in the U.S. Senate, and she understands the challenges facing diverse states like Wisconsin that rely on urban industry, small business and agriculture for economic growth."

"Today's decision is yet another example that this Administration simply considers itself above the law. This case arose from the Administration's politicization of national security intelligence and its efforts to punish those who spoke out against its policies. Four years into the Iraq war, Americans are still living with the consequences of this White House's efforts to quell dissent. This commutation sends the clear signal that in this Administration, cronyism and ideology trump competence and justice."
This will be my first and most important mission as President -- one I believe I have the strength and experience to complete. Today, I want to lay out my three point plan for how I would achieve this -- how, as President, I would bring our troops home, work to bring stability to the region, and replace a military force with a new diplomatic initiative to engage countries around the world in securing Iraq's future and America's national security interests.
Now, will any of this be easy? Of course not. It's going to take tremendous discipline, patience and hard work. But I believe it can be done. I believe we can be a lot smarter about getting out of this war than we were about getting into it. The future of our national security and international standing depends upon it. And we owe our troops -- and their families -- nothing less.

She will be firm in protecting our national security and fair in addressing the aspirations and needs of all Americans. Hillary Clinton has been my friend and ally in the battle for health care for many years and I look forward to working with her to achieve our common goals when she becomes our next President," Baldwin said.
"America is at crossroads and Senator Hillary Clinton is the only presidential candidate with the experience, intellect, and vision to lead our country in the right direction," Bilbray said. "I am confident that as president, Senator Clinton will work hard to strengthen America's position in the global economy, protect the nation from national security threats, and ensure that all Americans have an equal opportunity to reach their full potential."
Your mission says it all. Honor the dead by helping the livingâ€”through veteran services, community services, national security, and a strong national defense. But we have to begin with clear -eyed understanding of the new challenges and threats we face in the 21st century. From my service on the Senate Armed Services Committee, to my time as a First Lady and Senator, I have been privileged to travel to more than 80 countries representing America.
So when I'm President I will call upon our people to come together to support our veterans, in large ways as well as those small important kindnesses and recognition that can mean so much. Whether it's offering a job, or inviting someone to your child's school to speak, or saying a simple thank you line at church or in the line at the grocery store. We owe them everything and that means confronting our national security challenges with courage, strength and wisdom.
"Our nation's railroad system lacks the necessary safeguards to protect it from national security threats and also fails short on public safety standards," said Jack Fetters, Nevada state legislative director of the United Transportation Union. "We need a leader in the White House who understands the importance of securing the country's open railroads, keeping travelers and cargo safe. As a cosponsor of the Railroad Safety Enhancement Act of 2007, Senator Clinton has demonstrated that she is an outspoken advocate for expanding railroad safety and security. Throughout her presidency, Senator Clinton's leadership and commitment to the railroad industry and homeland security will play an important role in keeping our borders safe. The Nevada UTU will work hard to mobilize support for Senator Clinton's campaign spreading her message of change to voters throughout the Silver State."
"The world has reached a critical point, and we need a leader in the White House with the courage, intelligence and humility to navigate through many troubling challenges to our security at home and abroad. I believe Senator Clinton is that leader, and I whole-heartedly endorse her for President of the United States," General Clark said. "Our economic and national security has become more complicated than ever before, and we deserve a leader who draws on wisdom, compassion, intelligence and moral courage - in short, we need Hillary Clinton. She is tough but fair, a rock-solid leader equal to the many weighty challenges ahead of us."
"Hillary Clinton is a seasoned, experienced leader who will be ready to lead this country on Day One," Bayh said. "She will run the kind of campaign and administration that will appeal to all corners of America, emphasizing national security and middle class economic progress."
First elected to the Senate in 1998, Sen. Bayh has earned a reputation as a bipartisan problem solver, committed to strengthening our national security, growing small businesses to create new jobs and encouraging responsible fatherhood.
"I have seen firsthand how effective she is interacting with global leaders and the respect she commands," Bayh said. "I believe that her approach to our national security challenges will be strong but also more effective, because it will be more thoughtful and comprehensive than the current administration's. Senator Clinton is both tough and smart."
Now middle class families always end up drawing the short straw. Growth, according to this Republican philosophy, has to be unequal and government can't help. Instead, the Bush Administration gives no-bid contracts to political allies, allows no competition for senior citizens' drug prices under Medicare, and assumes no accountability for outsourcing national security responsibilities to contractors like Blackwater. They won't spend money to help working families get health insurance for their kids, but think nothing of giving health care providers billions more to take Medicare patients off the rolls.
"George Bush's faulty and offensive historical analogies aren't going to end the war in Iraq, make America safer or bring our troops home. Americans are tired of the President's efforts to play politics with national security and practice the politics of division.
Of course, this is a story about a place thousands of miles from here, in one of the most remote regions of our planet. But I share it because it is not an isolated experience any longer. It is a part of our story. It is part of Iowa's story and America's story. Alarming climate changes, a stagnant economy, our health weakened, our national security compromised -- because of our failure to move to a clean, efficient energy future.
There are also security implications. A group of retired 3 and 4-star generals and admirals issued a recent report describing in detail the threat that global warming poses to our national security, from increased conflict over natural resources to instability and migrations. Earlier this year, the Senate passed my legislation to require the Department of Defense to integrate this issue into our planning.
"Our next President will inherit the most difficult and challenging national security agenda in our nation's history. We need a President and Commander in Chief who will restore America's greatness, protect America by combining diplomacy and all elements of national power, provide strong leadership and make decisions based on evidence instead of ideology," said Lt. General Kerrick. "I know Hillary Clinton and her understanding of diplomacy and force will ensure that our wonderful military remains the best in the world and when deployed will be assigned winnable missions, will be adequately resourced, and will be supported with all elements of our national power."
"I strongly support Senator Clinton because I believe that she is the right person for the job - at the right time. She understands the military, both in its internal dynamics and as an instrument of policy," said Lt. General Ballard. "I believe that she will bring the right degree of concern for our all of Service members and their families. Her determination, fairness and toughness as the next Commander in Chief will enable her to make the hard but necessary decisions that will positively impact not only our military but our national security."
"We face many complex policy challenges in this country and abroad. From healthcare to national security, Hillary 'gets it'. We have enormous respect for Hillary's forward-looking agenda in energy, innovation, healthcare and the economy. She has the experience, judgment and leadership to strengthen America's standing in the world. One of the greatest challenges facing Americans and the world is sound energy policy, particularly addressing global warming. Hillary will assemble a world-class team to tackle these incredibly important issues, and we are pleased to support her."
"It is outrageous that the Bush administration would seek to circumvent the U.S. Congress on a matter of such vital interest to national security," Clinton said. "The President has ignored the American people's desire to end this war and is now engaging in a process that threatens to commit the United States to permanent bases in Iraq. This is unacceptable and I hope the President asks Congress to review this agreement. If he doesn't, Congress must act."
Despite the dramatic implications for American foreign policy and national security, the Administration says that it does not "anticipate that these negotiations will lead to the status of a formal treaty which would require formal negotiations or formal inputs from the Congress." At the same time, it has been reported that Iraqi officials plan to submit the agreement when it is concluded to the Iraqi parliament for approval.
"Bob is a leading voice on the most critical issues facing our nation, from education to national security to health care," Clinton said. "I am deeply honored to have his support and counsel as we take our message of change across America."
Blitzer: What about the specific criticism of your foreign policy judgment that we heard from Senator Obama, we heard earlier in the day from his chief strategist, David Axelrod. What about that, that implied criticism that some of your decisions on these national security, foreign policy issues raise questions about whether or not you should be president?
In a major display of momentum one day before the Nevada caucuses, Hillary Clinton today received the endorsement of Congressman Silvestre Reyes of Texas, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Congressman Reyes is one of the Democratic Party's leading voices on national security and U.S.-Mexico border issues. He will serve as the Clinton Campaign's Co-Chair for the Southwest Region.
Elected in 1996, Congressman Silvestre Reyes became the first Hispanic to represent the 16th District of Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives. In December 2006, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi selected Reyes to be Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, a committee on which Congressman Reyes has served since 2001. Prior to his election to Congress, Reyes served his country in Vietnam and then spent 26 years rising through the ranks of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service in the U.S. Border Patrol. He is a leader on intelligence, national security, immigration reform, and cross-border issues.
"Congressman Reyes is one of our wisest and most experienced leaders on national security and the particular issues that affect Americans living along the border and throughout the Southwest. I am proud to have his support and grateful for his advice," Senator Clinton said. "This endorsement is another sign of our growing momentum as we head into the Nevada caucuses."
In the days ahead of the primary, the campaign will highlight the real solutions that Hillary Clinton has proposed to the problems that Georgia families raise in every town hall meeting, issues of better jobs and more affordable health care, stronger protections against home foreclosures, and a smarter approach to national security. With more than 3,500 volunteers already signed up to help, Team Hillary is creating an impressive organization that will educate and motivate Georgia voters.
"We must act to address all the dangers posed by global warming, including where our national security is concerned. Congress's vote will guarantee that the administration is taking all due steps to address these challenges," said Senator Clinton.
The Clinton amendment implements many of the recommendations of a report authored by eleven retired three and four-star admirals and generals and released by the CNA Corporation in April. The study, "National Security and the Threat of Climate Change," concluded that global warming presents a "serious national security threat." The study examines how projected climate changes, such as rising sea levels, more intense tropical storms, increased flooding and drought, will have destabilizing impacts, including reduced access to fresh water, impaired food production, and displacement of major populations. The study concludes that these impacts could act as a "threat multiplier" and increase the potential for failed states, cause mass migrations that add to global tensions, and increase conflict over resources.
It is unfair, especially after seven years of Mr. Bush's inept leadership, but any Democrat will face tougher questioning about his or her fitness to be commander in chief. Mrs. Clinton has more than cleared that bar, using her years in the Senate well to immerse herself in national security issues, and has won the respect of world leaders and many in the American military. She would be a strong commander in chief.
As voters look to the future, they will be looking at who can put the country on the right path and who can defend it against future threats. While Hillary is seen as strong on defense and has served on the Armed Services Committee, Sen. Obama has limited experience on these national security issues that would again be front and center.
So if Sen. McCain is the nominee, Hillary is the one well-positioned to beat him. Already well vetted, she is ready to stand up to Sen. McCain on national security and put together a winning coalition of voters that will take back the White House.
In 2004, the Republicans peeled off close to 40% of the Latinos and many women concerned about national security - two groups that were pivotal in the 2004 general election. Catholics were another group Hillary swept that Democrats lost in 2004. The states and her strong diverse coalition of support presents a powerful case to the superdelegates looking at who can beat John McCain.
Sen. McCain Will Run on National Security; Hillary Wins That Argument. When it came to national security, "strong and wrong" won out over "right and weak" in the 2002 and 2004 elections. With Hillary, that is not and will not be an issue: Based on what they know of her and her experience, voters believe Hillary is fully ready to be commander in chief. She will be strong and right. Voters know she has the right policies - ending the war in Iraq, re-establishing our relations with our allies - and they know she has the strength of leadership that America's next president will need in a world that can turn dangerous in an instant. As such, the Republicans will not be able to play the national security card against Hillary Clinton, like they are now doing against Senator Obama, and that makes her a fundamentally stronger candidate against John McCain. Case in point is what George Bush said on Sunday morning about Sen. Obama, "I certainly don't know what he believes in. The only foreign policy thing I remember he said was he's going to attack Pakistan and embrace Ahmadinejad." With Hillary, the Republicans' national security argument blunted and the election debate will shift to healthcare and the economy - areas of decisive strength for Hillary.
Hillary is the best candidate to take on Sen. McCain and defeat him. She has outperformed at the ballot box throughout her career. She will neutralize the argument on national security so the election will turn on her ability to manage our economy and reform healthcare. The GOP will not be able to increase her negatives in a way they can with an untested candidate. And Hillary's core voters - working class, women, Latinos, Catholics - are exactly the voters that comprise the key swing voters the party has needed in the past to win. This is an observation I made in the Washington Post after the 2004 election, "Middle-aged women and Hispanic voters were key voting blocs that made the difference, swinging the vote from Kerry to Bush. In fact, in 2004 women made up 54 percent of the U.S. electorate, the highest percentage in history. Their interest in and impact on politics has been increasing." (Washington Post, 3/21/2006)."
Winning in November: Hillary is the Democrat to beat Sen. John McCain. Hillary has withstood Republican attacks, has the strength and experience to win on national security and has built a strong coalition of women and Latino voters. These two groups made the difference in 2004, swinging the election from Sen. John Kerry to President George Bush. Read more.
Over the past seven years, we've seen what happens when the president presents the American people with a series of false choices and then is indifferent about the consequences: force versus diplomacy, unilateralism versus multilateralism, hard power versus soft. We've seen the tragic result of having a president who had neither the experience nor the wisdom to manage our foreign policy and safeguard our national security. We can't let that happen again. America has already taken that chance— one time too many.
Electing a president should not be an either/or proposition when it comes to national security. We need a president who knows how to deploy both the olive branch and the arrows, who will be ready to act swiftly and decisively in a crisis, who will pursue strategic demands of hard diplomacy to re-establish moral authority and our leadership. In this moment of peril and promise, we need a president who is tested and ready, who can draw on years of real world experience working on many of the issues that we now confront, who knows when to stand ones ground and when to seek common ground, who has the strength and fortitude to meet the challenges head on without fear and without sowing fear.
We're going to start investing in manufacturing again. I believe you can't have a strong economy unless you have a strong manufacturing sector. We can't rely on other countries to produce what the American military needs. So it's not only a question for our economy, it's a question for our national security. I believe we could create at least five million green collar jobs with clean renewable energy that would put Ohioans to work starting soon. I also know that if we invest in our infrastructure - more bridges, tunnels, roads, water systems, sanitation systems - we would put a lot of people to work and we would upgrade our infrastructure for the 21st century. In order to do that, we're going to close every tax loophole that still gives one penny of your tax dollars to any company that exports a job. Instead we're going to put that money to work here.
In Case You Missed It: During Tuesday's debate, Sen. Obama said he was too busy running for President to hold a single substantive hearing of the national security subcommittee he chairs in the Senate. Watch.
"One of the most important duties of the President is ensuring the safety of the American people," said retired General Wesley Clark. "Inevitably, another national security crisis will occur. And when it does, voters shouldn't have to wonder whether their President will be ready. As President, Hillary will be ready to act swiftly and decisively."
"The stakes for our nation have never been higher," said Retired General John Watkins. "As someone who has met with world leaders and is a leader on national security in the US Senate, I am confident that Hillary Clinton is ready to serve as our nation's Commander in Chief on day one. She would come to the job more prepared than most of our recent Presidents and certainly with better judgment."
...My opponent and I are in an important debate about national security - and which one of us is best prepared to take charge as Commander-in-Chief.
We are running for the most important job in the world, and you can't run away from a debate on national security. - - -
In an effort to deflect attention from voters asking whether he is ready to lead on national security, Barack Obama launched a series of negative attacks against Hillary Clinton today.
And real change isn't running away from a debate on national security because you don't have the strength and the experience to go toe to toe with John McCain.

"She has done her homework on national security and I know from my personal discussions with her and with many other friends that go in and brief her in her role in the Senate Armed Services Committee. She knows the facts, she knows the details, plus she has the big picture. She is a strategic thinker but she has the building blocks of the strategy in her personal knowledge. This is someone that when she is president our military is going to respect very highly, and when our Senior Officers brief her and meet with her they are going be very, very impressed by what she knows and the intelligence that she brings to these problems."
Brigadier General John Watkins, Jr.
"Sen. Obama is so desperate to divert attention from his limited national security experience that he's not just misleading voters about Sen. Clinton, he's also misleading voters about his own supporters. That is not change you can believe in." -- Clinton spokesperson Phil Singer
Ready to Lead: Hillary compares her national security experience to that of Sens. McCain and Obama. Watch.
Announcer: Hillary Clinton will never be too busy to defend our national security-bringing our troops home from Iraq and pursing Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.
Hillary's record during the Clinton Administration speaks to her judgment and her ability to lead our nation through times of national security crises. Hillary represented America in more than 80 countries. She worked to open borders in the Balkans, bring peace in Northern Ireland and stood up in China for women's rights and human rights.
"The people of Pennsylvania are focused on the two largest issues facing our nation - the state of our economy and national security. On both counts, Pennsylvanians understand how important it is to elect someone who is truly ready to become President and Commander-in-Chief. Hillary is ready to lead our nation, returning us to both prosperity and peace.
The Obama campaign's negative strategy builds on one it already had in place. In Ohio and Texas, Senator Obama outspent us by a 2 to 1 margin and engaged in a negative campaign for weeks in advance on the March 4 elections. He sent negative mail that was declared misleading and false by top news organizations and ran radio ads that attacked Sen. Clinton on national security. At the same time, Senator Obama and his surrogates unleashed a barrage of negative and misleading attacks on Sen. Clinton focusing on a variety of issues.
Today Hillary Clinton announced her plans to address the forgotten front line in Afghanistan as she met with a group of respected retired admirals, generals, and other senior officials to discuss current foreign policy and national security challenges.
More than thirty former admirals and generals, including two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and five retired officers at the four-star rank have endorsed Hillary Clinton to be our next Commander-in-Chief. Eighteen of these esteemed flag and general officers and other senior national security officials took part in a rare conference call with reporters earlier this month; eleven met in person with Senator Clinton last week in Washington for a private conversation about ending the war in Iraq and winning the war in Afghanistan; and to testify publicly for her leadership ability. In these testimonials below, these great Americans who have given so much to our country, say why they believe Senator Clinton is the best candidate of either party to be our next Commander-in-Chief.
"She has done her homework on national security and I know from my personal discussions with her and with many other friends that go in and brief her in her role in the Senate Armed Services Committee. She knows the facts, she knows the details, plus she has the big picture. She is a strategic thinker but she has the building blocks of the strategy in her personal knowledge. This is someone that when she is president our military is going to respect very highly, and when our Senior Officers brief her and meet with her they are going be very, very impressed by what she knows and the intelligence that she brings to these problems."
So by the middle of this summer when the additional surge forces have been sent home, we'll be right back at square one with 130,000 or more troops on the ground in Iraq. That President Bush seems to want to keep as many troops there after the surge as before and says that doing otherwise would endanger our progress is a clear admission that the surge has not accomplished its goals. Meanwhile, as we continue to police Iraq's civil war, the threats to our national security, our economy, and our standing in the world continue to mount.
Now, withdrawal is not risk-free, but the risks of staying in Iraq are certain. And a well-planned withdrawal is the one and only path to a political solution. The only way to spur the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own future and to ensure that we don't bear that responsibility indefinitely. The only way to spur other countries to do their part to help secure stability in the region. The commitment to staying in Iraq has driven President Bush's foreign policy. It looks like it would drive Senator McCain's foreign policy as well, but it will not drive mine. My foreign policy will be driven by what is in America's national security interests.
Over the last few weeks, the question of who is most ready to be Commander-in-Chief has rightfully dominated the presidential campaign. Who is ready to take the 3am call? Who has a record of action on national security issues? Who is ready to be president on day one?
Today, in a major speech ahead of the five year anniversary of the start of the Iraq war, Hillary Clinton outlined new proposals that build on her three-part plan to end the war responsibly. Five years after the start of the war, we have come to a crossroads. The war has sapped our military and economic strength, damaged U.S. national security, taken the lives of almost 4,000 brave young men and women in uniform, and placed a lasting toll on the tens of thousands of wounded, many with invisible injuries like Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The George W. Bush-John McCain strategy is to continue this failed policy. We need to end this war and bring our troops home. We need to press the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own country. We need to rebuild our alliances and enlist the international community in securing stability in Iraq and the region.

Economic Solutions: In the face of an ever-growing threat of instability in the financial markets, "3 a.m. calls can be about economic crises as well as national security ones, because it's all intertwined today," Hillary says. Read more.
This is the America we will build together - an America where the next generation is always better off than the last. But in order to begin to do this work, we have to win in November. That means we have to defeat Senator McCain; a good man with a great record of serving America. He's a friend and colleague of mine and I admire his service, but he is offering the wrong ideas for our country. It is important that in the fall election we have a nominee ready to go toe-to-toe with John McCain on national security. He is willing to keep troops in Iraq for up to 100 years. I'll start bringing them home within the first 60 days of my taking office.
"Senator McCain's Groundhog Day approach to Iraq means four more years of the Bush-Cheney-McCain policy of continuing to police a civil war while the threats to our national security, our economy, and our standing in the world mount. We simply cannot give the Iraqi government an endless blank check. It is time to end this war as quickly, as responsibly, and as safely as possible. That has been my mission in the Senate and it will be my mission starting on day one as President."
"So it is vital for our national security - and for the health and safety of our men and women in uniform - that we begin to end the war in Iraq and rebuild our military. A great Pennsylvanian, Benjamin Franklin once said, 'Well done is better than well-said.'"
Restoring a strong, vibrant manufacturing sector in America and Indiana by implementing a 21st Century manufacturing strategy that includes investing in innovation and efficiency; protecting defense-related manufacturing jobs to help ensure America's national security; expanding the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, which already assists more than 300 small and mid-sized Hoosier companies; and standing up for unions by working to pass the Employee Free Choice Act.
"The War in Iraq has been a harsh and daily toll on our men and women in uniform, many on their second, third, and fourth tour of duty. Among combat troops sent to Iraq for the third or fourth time, more than one in four show signs of anxiety, depression or acute stress, according to an official Army survey of soldiers' mental health," said Clinton. "And we cannot forget the toll on military families. So it is vital for our national security – and for the health and safety of our men and women in uniform – that we end the war in Iraq and begin to rebuild our military.
To strengthen national security and begin to relieve the strain on our armed forces, we need to end the war in Iraq, begin bringing our troops home safely and responsibly, and stabilize Iraq.
At a speech in Indianapolis today, Hillary Clinton outlined a plan to maintain a strong national security and keep good jobs in the U.S. Her plan will invest in a new generation of defense manufacturing jobs and research and development to maintain America's competitiveness, innovative edge, and to provide our military and our soldiers with the equipment and technology they need. Hillary's plan is in response to the growing trend of defense manufacturing jobs leaving the U.S., and with them critical technology and know-how to keep our country safe. Hillary believes that America must maintain and strengthen its capacity to produce key defense technologies to have a strong economy and strong national security.
Hillary's plan includes five major parts - launching a comprehensive review of the defense industrial base in the first 100 days, a new critical capabilities impact analysis for federal contracts, a requirement to review foreign investment in critical national security industries and technologies, protecting "Buy America" provisions for metals that are vital to national security, and a new inter-agency task force to combat industrial espionage.
Hillary Clinton believes a strong defense industrial base is one of the foundations of the U.S. economy and is essential to ensuring our technological edge and safeguarding national security. Defense manufacturing also provides good, high-paying jobs for workers in Indiana and across the country. Below is a full outline of her plan:
2. A New Critical Capabilities Impact Analysis for Federal Contracts. It is vitally important for the United States to maintain its capacity to produce domestically what we need to protect our national security interests. Our defense manufacturing industry not only provides vital jobs and economic benefits to communities across Indiana and the United States but ensures that we maintain the technology and know-how to keep our citizens safe. Under current procurement rules, the Department of Defense is not allowed to consider the impact on American jobs our national security technological capacity. As a result there is often little reliable independent information on the impact of these contracting decisions, which can affect entire communities and the security of our economy. As President, Senator Clinton would require that an independent, third-party to work with bidders on defense contracts to conduct an impact analysis on critical capabilities - including U.S. jobs - so that the Department of Defense, Congress and other interested parties have a full and complete picture of the impact of procurement decisions. This new analysis will help ensure that we maintain an independent, competitive procurement process that is in the best interest of our country and our workers.
3. New Public Periodic Review Requirement of Foreign Investments in Critical National Security Industries and Technologies. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) plays an important role in ensuring that technologies and industries critical to U.S. national security are not sold off and outsourced to foreign governments. Senator Clinton has been an outspoken proponent of strengthening CFIUS and supported the 2007 legislation that was signed into law to increase oversight and transparency in the CFIUS process. However, despite these improvements, there is no mechanism currently in place to review CFIUS decisions once they are made. The story of Magnaquench highlights how important it can be to review foreign investments in key U.S. industries, to ensure that foreign investors and foreign governments are sticking to the terms of the agreements they made. That's why today, Senator Clinton called for requiring new periodic public reviews of CFIUS decisions on mergers, acquisitions, and agreements. These reviews will ensure that approved mergers have not changed in a manner that would be harmful to our national security interests. She will require that all periodic reports are published in the Federal Register so they are accessible to the public.
4. Protecting "Buy America" Provisions for Metals that are Vital to Our National Security. The United States must ensure that it maintains a secure source for the metals that are used to build out aircraft, ships and weaponry. We cannot afford to have our national security hinge on whether we can secure key inputs from other countries like China, which have shown a clear willingness to break and bend trade rules. Last year, Senator Bayh led an effort in Congress to strengthen the "specialty metals clause" which requires that certain vital metals used in defense manufacturing must be produced here in the United States. This provision helps ensure we maintain our independence and security, and that we maintain good, high-paying defense manufacturing jobs in Indiana and across the country. However, the Bush Administration and John McCain have made clear that they want to eviscerate this key provision. As President, Hillary will work to protect and strengthen the specialty metal clause to help ensure a strong, independent defense manufacturing base in America.
Today, in Radnor, Pennsylvania, Hillary Clinton was joined by Congressman and retired vice admiral Joe Sestak as she outlined her plan to end the war responsibly. Five years after the start of the war, we have come to a crossroads. The war has sapped our military and economic strength, damaged U.S. national security, taken the lives of almost 4,000 brave young men and women in uniform, and placed a lasting toll on the tens of thousands of wounded, many with invisible injuries like Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The Bush-Cheney-McCain strategy is to continue this failed policy. We need to end this war and bring our troops home swiftly, responsibly, and safely. We need to press the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own country. We need to rebuild our alliances and enlist the international community in securing stability in Iraq and the region.

Well, this election in the fall needs to be between the Republican and the Democratic candidate, toe-to-toe on national security, taking them to task over the economy, standing up for universal health care, talking about the issues that matter here at home and around the world. And I believe that I am the better candidate to do that.
To strengthen national security and begin to relieve the strain on our armed forces, we need to end the war in Iraq, begin bringing our troops home safely and responsibly, and stabilize Iraq.
The Bush Administration's refusal to meet or negotiate seriously with North Korea in its first five years has been enormously costly to our national security. During those years, it is estimated the North produced enough plutonium for up to ten nuclear bombs. It conducted its first nuclear test. It has continued its proliferation activities, including as we have learned in recent press reports, helping Syria build a nuclear reactor.
"I am honored to have the support of Congressman Chris Carney," said Hillary Clinton. "Chris has run and won in a competitive district in a key battleground state. He understands what it takes to bring people together. I look forward to relying upon his advice and expertise on national security and foreign affairs as we work together to restore America's leadership in the world."
"This morning, John McCain said that four more years of the same strategy will produce victory in Iraq, though he provided no new approach or new proposals. This is not the first time Senator McCain has predicted victory in Iraq. He promises more of the same Bush policies that have weakened our military, our national security, and our standing in the world. Our country cannot afford more empty promises on Iraq. When I am President, the United States will no longer give Iraq a blank check. I will bring this war to a swift and honorable conclusion, and bring our troops home, beginning within 60 days of taking office."
So, our party will have a tough choice to make. Who is ready to lead our party at the top of our ticket? Who is ready to defeat Senator McCain in the swing states and among swing voters? Who is ready to rebuild the economy and the war in Iraq and protect our national security as Commander-in-Chief? Who is ready on Day One to lead?
So we do need to set a high bar for trade agreements. We should support them if they create jobs, raise wages and advance our national security. And we should be prepared to walk away if they don't. To create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more Americans.
He says with national security secrets running through it. He says Russians, Chinese, even 18-year-olds could have hacked into your server.
"As I have said many times, we need to be sure that new trade deals meet clear tests: They have to create good American jobs, raise wages, and advance our national security. The bar has to be set very high for two reasons.
Our nation has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy and national security. Not that we always agree — far from it — but we do come together when it counts.

Our nation has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy and national security. Not that we always agree—far from it—but we do come together when it counts.
One the final language of the treaty itself, which I don't think went far enough to meet the test that I've always applied to any trade agreement—I have voted for them and I have voted against them when I was a senator—does it help to create more good paying jobs in America? Does it raise incomes, does it advance our national security?
"AFGE members make America run—protecting our national security, keeping our families healthy through food inspections, and serving our military in civilian support roles. And for decades, AFGE members have helped build the American middle class by fighting for higher wages, safer working conditions, and the right to organize and bargain collectively.
And it is hard to take seriously senators who talk tough but then hold up key national security nominations, including the top official at the Treasury Department responsible for disrupting terrorist financing.
Demonizing Muslims doesn't just go against everything we stand for as Americans—it also threatens our national security. We need to stand up to disgraceful anti-Muslim rhetoric and build trust so that our communities can work hand in hand with law enforcement to stop terrorism.
Addressing national security at the second Democratic debate, the day after a horrific terror attack in Paris. November 14, 2015
On Tuesday, 10 former senior U.S. diplomats and national security officials who have served across multiple administrations issued a joint statement raising questions about Senator Bernie Sanders' proposals for countering ISIS and dealing with Iran:
"Over the past four debates, the subject of ISIS and Iran have come up a number of times. These are complex and challenging times, and we need a Commander in Chief who knows how to protect America and our allies and advance our interests and values around the world. The stakes are high. And we are concerned that Senator Sanders has not thought through these crucial national security issues that can have profound consequences for our security.
And when it comes to foreign policy and national security, well, I think we have a lot to do to keep our country safe, and I have some ideas that I've been putting out based on what I did in the Senate after 9/11, based on my work as secretary of State.
When I started running for president, I didn't know that some of the issues I've been talking about would end up front and center in my campaign. I knew I'd present my vision for where our economy should be in the 21st century. I knew we'd talk about national security, about how we can build on and improve the Affordable Care Act, and about my proposals to support small businesses, raise wages, and create good-paying jobs.
According to a new report Thursday, the State Department Inspector General has determined that work-related emails sent on personal accounts belonging to former Secretary of State Colin Powell and to senior aides to former Secretary Condoleezza Rice contain classified national security information. This conclusion – which was reached despite the lack of any classification markings within the emails – has been strenuously opposed by Secretary Powell, who has called for these emails to be released.
