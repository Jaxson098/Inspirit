So there will be a lot of debate about weapons systems, no question about it. And a lot of communities around the country rely upon defense spending and the jobs that accrue as a result of defense spending.
And so I sent a budget to the United States Congress. I'm proud to report all of them on the stage are with me on this one. It's a budget that increases our monies for security, significantly increases defense spending. Those who wear our uniform deserve the best: the best training, the best equipment, another pay raise. The price of freedom is high; the price of security is high; but this Nation will pay it.
And that's why I've submitted a budget to the United States Congress that significantly increases our defense spending. It's the largest increase in 20 years. And here's why. First, this is a long struggle, and it's not an easy struggle. And secondly, anytime the United States commits our troops into harm's way, they must have the best equipment, the best training, the best possible pay. The price of freedom is high, no question about it. But it is not too high, as far as I'm concerned.
You've got to know how proud I am of the United States military. What a great group. I asked the United States Congress for a significant increase in defense spending. And I know the two gentlemen up here, if they were in the Halls of the Congress, would be strongly supporting what I'm about to tell you. The reason I asked for the biggest increase since President Ronald Reagan was the President is because I believe this: Anytime you commit an American youth into harm's way, they must have the best equipment, the best training, the best pay possible.
The President. Well, I think they ought to wait until we have—the Secretary presents a strategic vision. I said during the campaign—as you know, Tom—I worry about defense spending based upon politics and not based upon a strategic vision. I said that again today. I said the strategy and the spending ought to follow. I don't think Members ought to worry about that. I think they ought to be pleased with that type of approach to budgeting.
We should also prepare for the unexpected, for the uncertainties of the future. We should approach our Nation's budget as any prudent family would, with a contingency fund for emergencies or additional spending needs. For example, after a strategic review, we may need to increase defense spending. We may need to increase spending for our farmers or additional money to reform Medicare. And so, my budget sets aside almost a trillion dollars over 10 years for additional needs. That is one trillion additional reasons you can feel comfortable supporting this budget.
Third, we agreed on the need to commit the resources that will allow NATO's forces to do their jobs. The decline in defense spending amongst NATO nations must be reversed. And when we do spend, we must spend wisely. It shouldn't be a question of whether to buy American or buy European; it should be a question of how to buy transatlantic. North American and European companies should collaborate to produce the most advanced systems at the lowest costs.
To build our future force, the armed services must continue to attract America's best people with good pay and good living conditions. Our military culture must reward new thinking, innovation, and experimentation. Congress must give defense leaders the freedom to innovate, instead of micromanaging the Defense Department. And every service and every constituency of our military must be willing to sacrifice some of their own pet projects. Our war on terror cannot be used to justify obsolete bases, obsolete programs, or obsolete weapon systems. Every dollar of defense spending must meet a single test: It must help us build the decisive power we will need to win the wars of the future.
My '03 budget calls for more than $48 billion in new defense spending. This will be the largest increase in defense spending in the last 20 years, and it includes another pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform.
My budget calls for the largest increase in defense spending in the last 20 years, investing in more precision weapons, missile defenses, unmanned vehicles, and high-tech equipment for our soldiers on the ground. I will also seek another pay increase for the men and women who wear our country's uniform. We will spend what it takes to win the war against terrorism.
My budget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two decades, because while the price of freedom and security is high, it is never too high. Whatever it costs to defend our country, we will pay.
We fight for freedom, and we stand for freedom, and we won't relent until we defend freedom at its core. And that's why the budget I sent up there has got a significant increase in defense spending, because we owe it to the defenders of freedom to give them the best equipment, the best housing, the best training, and another pay raise.

Now, all budgets have got to be based on priorities, and mine are clear: The Government's most solemn duty is to defend and protect the American people. In a time of war, we will always provide our military and homeland security personnel with the tools they need to do their jobs. And so our budget raises defense spending by almost 5 percent and funds critical upgrades in homeland security, such as a new program to secure our chemical plants, ports, and public transportation systems.
In terms of security, we understand that protecting our borders is a crucial checkpoint on the road to our collective prosperity. Our safe borders secure our people not only against terrorism, but they make possible a speedy flow of goods, services, and people and information among our three nations. And standing on the shoulders of the Smart Borders Initiative, we are making new investments in security and in defense spending. Quite simply, Canada is a full and forceful partner in building a secure North America.

But I want to tell you all, the best way to secure the homeland is to hunt the enemy down wherever they hide and bring them to justice, and that's exactly what we're going to do. The budget I submitted to the United States Congress not only makes our homeland security a priority, it makes the defense of the United States a priority. It's the largest increase in defense spending in 20 years. And the reason why is twofold.
And the other reason why I've submitted a significant increase in the defense spending is because we're in this thing for the long haul. We defend freedom. We're fighting murderers, coldblooded killers who hate what America stands for. They hate our religious tolerance. They hate the fact that we speak freely. They can't stand our democracy. And they want to hit us again. And we're going to chase them down one by one, until we rid the world of the global reach of terror. We have no other choice, my fellow Americans. We fight for our children's freedom.
