And, again, the underlying premise—and, again, I've not had a chance to thoroughly go into the report—the decision. But it basically says all the decisions relating to your private life—who you marry, whether or not you decide to conceive a child or not, whether or not you can have an abortion, a range of other decisions—whether or not—how you raise your child—what does this do—and does this mean that in Florida they can decide they're going to pass a law saying that same-sex marriage is not permissible, it's against the law in Florida?
And also, on a separate issue, what's the next step on abortion once this case gets settled?
The President. As I said when I—when this hit, as I was getting on the plane to go down to Alabama, this is about a lot more than abortion. I haven't—I hadn't read the whole opinion at that time.
The Court has done what it has never done before: expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many Americans that had already been recognized. The Court's decision to do so will have real and immediate consequences. State laws banning abortion are automatically taking effect today, jeopardizing the health of millions of women, some without exceptions.
In fact, the Court laid out State laws criminalizing abortion that go back to the 1800s—[laughter]—as a rationale, the Court literally taking America back 150 years.
So if a woman lives in a State that restricts abortion, the Supreme Court's decision does not prevent her from traveling from her home State to the State that allows it. It does not prevent a doctor in that State—in that State—from treating her.
The President. Right to privacy, it's not just abortion rights. But yes, abortion rights.
And your views on abortion have evolved in your public life. Are you the best messenger to carry this forward when Democrats—many of them, many progressives—want you to do more? [Laughter]
So the choice is clear: We either elect Federal Senators and Representatives who will codify Roe, or Republicans who will elect the House and Senate will try to ban abortions nationwide. Nationwide. This is going to go one way or the other after November.
We also, by the way—I think we're going to have to see—and this relates to Governor Hochul as well—that funding for family planning, not—not for abortion, but for family planning.
You've all probably had a chance to the read the decision and the dissent. The majority rattles off laws from the 19th century to support the idea that Roe was historic—was a historic anomaly because States outlawed abortion in the 1880s, toward the end. But that's just wrong.
The truth is, today's Supreme Court majority that is playing fast and loose with the facts. Even 150 years ago, the common law and many State laws did not criminalize abortion early in pregnancy, which is very similar to the viability line drawn by Roe.
But the Dobbs majority ignores that fact. And the Dobbs majority ignores that many laws were enacted to protect women at the time when they were dying from unsafe abortions. This is the horrific reality that Roe sought to end. The practice of medicine should not—I emphasize—should not be frozen in the 19th century.
You know, and wiping out the right to choose on—whether you have incest, abortion—I mean, excuse me, incest or having a rape or—I mean, it just—this is just extreme. You know, even the life of the mother is in question in some cases—in some States.
Republicans in Congress and their extreme MAGA ideology are determined to go even further, talking about nationwide bans on—that would outlaw abortion in every State, under every circumstance, going after the broader right to privacy as well. But as I've said before, this fight is not over. And we saw that last night in Kansas.
Last night, in Congress—in Kansas, they found out. Women and men did exercise their electoral and political power. With a record turnout, voters of Kansas defeated a ballot initiative to remove the right to choose an abortion from the Kansas constitution. It was in the Kansas constitution. They're trying to strike it and eliminate it from the Kansas constitution.
You know, today I'm signing a second Executive order—I'm about to sign—that responds to the health care crisis that has unfolded since the Supreme Court overturned Roe and that women are facing all across America. The health care crisis is—you know, it's just—it's hard for me to even under—understand how they think this. The health care crisis is, women can't get—can't choose, can't get an abortion even in a case of incest, even in the case of rape.
Just yesterday, in Idaho, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to make sure that pregnant women facing serious threats to their health can get the medical care they need in Medicare-funded emergency rooms. Under Federal law, no woman—whether pregnant or not, no matter where she lives—should be turned away or denied necessary treatment during a medical crisis. The Justice Department stepped in to make sure that this extreme State law criminalizing abortion does not put women's health and lives at risk in these situations.
You know, this Executive order also helps women travel out of State for medical care. Secretary Becerra is going to work with States through the Medicaid to allow them to provide reproductive health care for women who live in States where abortions are being banned in that State.
So how extreme are these MAGA Republicans? Just take a look what happened since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. In red States after red State, there's a race to pass the most restrictive abortion limitations imaginable, even without exception for rape or incest.
Mayor O'Neal. Well, I think that you can primarily list—I think one of my colleagues here this morning mentioned Viagra. If you start to talk about taking away the rights of men to take it, then what do we have? Or if we think about the fact that there are medical procedures that men can have as well—because an abortion is a medical procedure—there are medical procedures that men can have that will help them not to contribute to the making of a child.
County Judge Lina Hidalgo of Harris County, TX. Mr. President, as you know, I'm a county executive in Houston. And it was tragic: Just yesterday the trigger law in Texas came into effect. And it means that abortion is banned from the time of fertilization and that anyone who performs an abortion could be charged with a felony, and the penalty could be up to life in prison. And so, as we celebrate Women's Equality Day, we have everything but equality when it comes to this issue.
I'm hearing a lot of concern from our doctors in the community. Our public hospital system provides abortions when they're medically necessary. And those doctors are telling us they're not going to be able to determine anymore when it is legal to provide an abortion, because the law in Texas has no exemptions for rape or incest; only allows an abortion exception when the life of the mother is in danger or they're at danger of irreparable harm.
And we've got to change it, as you say, at the ballot box. But look, we have that, we have a bounty law, and we have a legislative session that's going to start in January where they're looking at tackling contraception—access to contraception. They're already talked about banning that—banning the pill that helps women seek abortion who can't make it to a clinic physically; that would make it even harder for women to travel.
A woman in Houston would have to travel 600 miles to get to the nearest abortion clinic in New Mexico. And so we need help figuring out how to get women to be able to seek that abortion, to travel to these States that are offering us safe havens.
Well, just take a look at what's happened since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. In 14 States, abortion is not available beyond 6 weeks of pregnancy, when most women don't even know they are pregnant. In most of these States, there is no exception for rape or incest. In the coming weeks and months, another 13 States may ban abortion depending on the outcome of this election in November—another 13.
That means, in just weeks and months, more than half of America will have banned abortion if we don't win this off-year election. And they're not going to stop there. If they win control of the House and Senate, they've made it clear: They're going to try to pass a national ban. But as long as I'm President, they ain't going to get it done, because I'll veto it.
And here's the deal. Guess what? On choice, Democrats want to codify Roe—not what you have—what you have on the ballot. Republicans want a national ban on abortion. In fact, Gretchen's opponent supports an extreme ban with no exceptions for rape or incest or the life of the mother. Gretchen supports the ballot initiative to put the right to reproductive freedom in your State constitution.
The MAGA Republicans just cheered and embraced the first Supreme Court decision in our entire history—the first one in our entire history—that just didn't fail to preserve a constitutional freedom, it actually took away a fundamental right that had been granted by the same Court to so many Americans: the constitutional right to choose. And now nearly half the States in the United States of America have either passed a ban on abortion or will shortly. And in many States, abortion is already banned even in cases of rape and incest, a fundamental change.
Already, 166 House Republicans have signed on to a bill that would ban abortion nationwide. And the senior Senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, has proposed a national ban on abortion with criminal penalties put on doctors and put them in jail if they, in fact, violate the ban.
So, in 46 days, America is going to choose: If Republicans win control of the Congress, abortion will be banned. And by the way, it will be initially banned, but if they win Congress, I will veto it.
And so, you know—and whether or not it's—on choice, you know, I—as I've said when this decision was handed down, you know, it's not going to just be the issue of abortion. It's going to be contraception. And you're already seeing that debate taking place in States where they're trying to outlaw the ability of people—there was a famous case, Griswold v. Connecticut, where, in the late sixties—that the Supreme Court said, in the privacy of their own bedroom, a man and woman should be able to choose whether or not they can use contraception and is—it's not the government's business, because they had outlawed the use of contraception.
Republicans are going to ban abortion nationwide. By the way, if they do that, as long as I'm President, I'll veto it so it won't happen. But no exceptions for rape or incest—none—or the life of the mother.
But you know, when you have positions that—and by the way, the Republicans have made it clear that they're going to pass a national ban if they win—a national ban on abortion. No exceptions for rape, incest, life of the mother.
You know, it's only been 4 months since the Dobbs decision, but we're no longer have to imagine the chaos and the heartache it's causing. In just 4 months, abortion bans have gone into effect in 16 States; 26.5 million women of reproductive age already live in States subject to these bans.
Meanwhile, congressional Republicans are doubling down on their extreme positions. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader of the House, has said that if they take control of the House, our work is, quote, "far from done." He wants the United States Congress to pass a law that would ban abortion nationwide.
Senator Lindsey Graham called for an abortion ban that criminalizes doctors and nurses who provide medical care for their patients in need. If Republicans get their way with a national ban, it won't matter where you live in America. So let me be very clear: If such a bill were to pass in the next several years, I'll veto it. But we can't let it pass in the first instance.
Immediately after the Dobbs decision came down, I signed an order and my administration took a number of actions to protect the access to reproductive health care, including emergency medical care; to protect a woman's right to travel from a State that prohibits abortion to a State that allows it; and to protect the privacy of sensitive health information preserving—preventing States from tracking women who are seeking help, because that's what some will do.
So if the United States Congress and the President were to sign a law saying, "We outlaw abortion under any circumstance," it's the law of the land under the Supreme Court ruling. We're going to do the opposite. We're going to make sure Roe v. Wade becomes the law of the land.
We're going to protect—[applause]. Democrats are going to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms like the right to choose, the right to privacy, the right to vote—our very democracy. Republicans have already introduced legislation that will ban abortion with no exceptions to rape or incest or the life of the mother, in many places.
Let me be clear: Republicans are going to pass a national ban on abortion if they control the Congress. I'll veto it right away, but—but—if we elect more Senate Democrats and keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January for all the Nation. You have that power with your vote.
Look, the bottom line is this: If Republicans gain control of—in Congress and pass the national-wide ban on abortion, I will veto it. But if we elect to the Senate two more Democrats and keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January so it's the law of the land—[applause]—and take us back to what the law used to be before Dobbs. Fifty years' worth of security.
Democracy is on the ballot this year, along with your right to choose and the right to privacy. The bottom line is this: If Republicans gain control the Congress and pass a nationwide ban on abortion, I'll veto it. But—[applause]—if Val Demings and more Senate Democrats get elected to keep control of the Senate and the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January. Make it the law of the land.
And folks, look, we heard Republicans say they want to make permanent the Dobbs decision, the Supreme Court's decision on abortion.
The Republican Congress already introduced legislation for a national ban on the right to choose. Michelle's opponent has promised to do the same thing here in New Mexico, saying he'll pass a Statewide ban. Instead, Michelle repealed the 1969 law on the books that criminalized abortion.
Look, the bottom line is this: If Michelle's opponent wins, the right to choose here in New Mexico is going to go away. And then if Republicans gain control of the Congress and pass a nationwide ban, as the Senator from South Carolina wants to do, the ban on abortion, I will veto it. It won't happen. But if we elect more Senate Democrats and keep control of the House, we're going to be able to codify Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.
And if they gain control of the Congress, they plan on passing a national—nationwide ban on abortion across the board, because now the Supreme Court says there's no right to privacy in the Constitution; it's up to the States, which means it's up to the Congress and affect all the States.
But if Republicans take control of the Congress, they're going to pass another ban. They want to have a national ban on abortion.
His position is extreme. For example, he's been down in Washington voting over and over again to defund Planned Parenthood. He's in the—and look, here's the bottom line: If Republicans gain control of Congress and pass a nationwide ban on abortion, I will veto it. And if we elect—they give me two more Democrats in the Senate and we keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January and make it the law of the land.
The President. If you elect Wes your Governor, he's going to make sure the right to choose is protected for every woman in Maryland. If Republicans gain control of Congress and pass a nationwide ban on abortion, I will veto it. And, folks, if we elect Chris Van Hollen and elect two more Democrats and keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January and make it the rule of the land.
And I want to be very clear: Under no circumstances will I support the proposal put forward by Senators Johnson and the Senator from down in Florida to cut or make fundamental changes in Social Security and Medicare. That's not on the table. I will not do that. I will veto any attempt to pass a national ban on abortion.
And one more thing: If Republicans pass—and I got—don't think they can do it now—a ban—a national ban to ban abortion, I will veto it. It's simple. We need to codify Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.
The President. Congress must restore the right that was taken away in Roe v. Wade and protect Roe v. Wade. Give every woman the constitutional right. The Vice President and I are doing everything to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient safety. But already, more than a dozen States are enforcing extreme abortion bans.
And what's really remarkable is despite the will of the American people, MAGA Republicans have made clear that they don't intend to stop with the Dobbs decision. No, they won't, until they get a national ban on abortion. Speaker McCarthy said, quote, "Our work is far from done." End of quote. Senator Lindsey Graham wants to——
The President. ——wants to criminalize doctors and nurses who provide medical care for their patients; make it a crime. Republicans in Congress have proposed three national abortion bans just this last year. Well, make no mistake about it: If somehow Congress were to pass a national ban, I will veto it.
I signed legislation increasing funding for childcare and development block grants by 30 percent, helping low-income families afford childcare. But there's so much more to do. And we're fighting over abortion?
But think about what's happened, what we've done in terms of individual rights—individual rights, everything from gay—LBGTQ rights all the way through to rights relating to having an abortion. You know, I'm determined to bring back Roe v. Wade. And my objective to do that is to get the States—half the States to decide that, because now the Court said, you know, it's State issue.
So I'm—you know, I happen to be a practicing Catholic. I'm not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right. Roe v. Wade cut in a place where the vast majority of religions have reached agreement. Historically, the first 3 months or thereabouts, in all major religions, was: That's between a woman and her doctor. The next 3 months is between—I mean, just a woman and her family. Next 3 months is between a woman and her doctor. The last 3 months have to be negotiated, because you can't—unless you are in a position where your physical health is at stake—you can't do it.
And so, in addition to that, we found out that it used to be an accepted principle that rape and incest were exceptions—were exceptions to that rule. Look at the States that have changed the rules. Look at the States that have changed the rules. State legislatures. Did you ever think you'd see a day when you would not only—forget your position on abortion—but were rape and incest were not even considered, number one? Couldn't be. And at the same time, we're in a situation where you were—we're banning books in schools, and not just any—not just the schoolboard; anybody can come in and call for the banning of a book.
As long as I'm President—I respect people who have differing views on abortion. But I thought Roe v. Wade got it pretty right. It—[inaudible]—three trimesters, and it all—and I'm trying to codify Roe v. Wade. Codify Roe v. Wade. I think we've got a shot at doing it.
The only reason abortion bans in America is because of Donald Trump. He's the only reason teenagers in Ohio are being forced to travel out of State to get their health care because they—because of Donald Trump—where they've been raped or—by a family member or by anyone else.
In Virginia, the Republican Governor tried to gain control of the State legislature and use it as a launching pad for the Presidency—a plan he has abandoned—[laughter]—in the process of banning abortion—attempting to. But guess what? He got trounced.
So let's be absolutely clear what Trump's bragging about. The only reason there is an abortion ban in America is because of Donald Trump. The only reason teenagers in Ohio are being forced to travel out of State to get their health care is because of Donald Trump. The only reason a fundamental right has been stripped away from the American people for the first time in American history is because of Donald Trump.
In Virginia, a Republican Governor tried to gain control of the State legislature. Lost both houses and lost his—and he abandoned—he was defeated in his attempt to ban abortion in any circumstance. And guess what? He got trounced.

Folks, look, now Trump is running for President bragging that he killed Roe v. Wade. So, let's be absolutely clear what Trump is bragging about. The only person there is—there—the only reason there's a ban on abortion and the circumstances in many places is because of Donald Trump. The only reason a teenager in Ohio who was—I'm in front of the kids; I won't say the circumstance—but was made pregnant by someone that attacked her had to move out of State—had to move out of State for health care is because of Donald Trump.

Trump's new Speaker supports a national ban on abortion under any circumstances, just as we've seen the radical bans in States all across America. And just in the last few days, the Republican legislature in New Hampshire has come forward in proposal of a 15-day ban—a 15-day ban. After 15 days, all abortions are banned for whatever reason—not 15 weeks, 15 days.

Trump's new Speaker supports a national ban on abortion under any circumstances. And as we've just seen, radical bans in States all across America have been supported by them.

Just as in the last few days, the Republican legislature in New Hampshire has put forward for approval a 15-day ban on any abortion—15 days, not 15 weeks. Fifteen days.

I believe Roe v. Wade was right. I'm not supporting—we didn't—they didn't support abortion on demand. It was Roe v. Wade. Roe v. Wade was the decision. And a majority of Americans agree.
That cruel reality is the result of extreme Republicans who, for years, have made it their mission to end the Roe v. Wade decision. Since Roe was overturned, in 21 States, abortion bans are now in effect, many with no exception for rape or incest.
And the extreme right is trying to limit all women in America from getting a safe and effective medication, approved by the Federal Drug Administration over 20 years ago based on the FDA's independent expert judgment. They're trying to block women from getting this medication even in States where abortion is legal.
Since the Court overturned Roe v. Wade, every single time abortion has been on the ballot—and by the way, a lot of people don't really understand. The Court said that it's up to the States to decide whether or not abortions are valid. So it says that if the State comes along and wants to say, "No, no, it's valid in my State—Roe v. Wade is valid in my State," it's allowed.
NOTE: The President spoke at 2:44 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Tani Malhotra, obstetrician-gynecologist and maternal and fetal medicine specialist, University Hospitals, and assistant professor, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, who introduced the President; Dallas, TX, resident Kate Cox, who, due to Texas's restrictive abortion law, traveled to another State to obtain an abortion after receiving a lethal fetal diagnosis; State Attorney General W. Kenneth Paxton, Jr., of Texas; Sen. Randal H. Paul; Rep. George J. "Mike" Kelly, Jr.; Sen. Lindsey O. Graham; and State Attorney General Steve Marshall of Alabama.
So let's be absolutely clear what Trump is bragging about. The reason there are 21 States where abortion bans are in effect, may [many; White House correction] with no exception for rape or any other—or incest, is Donald Trump.
The President. And frankly, Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, including the Speaker of the House, are hell-bent on going even further. To date, MAGA Republicans in Congress have proposed three additional national abortion bans to criminalize health care in every State.
But as long as I have the power of the Presidency, know this: If Congress were to pass a national abortion ban, I will veto it. I will veto it.
I've made it clear: If the MAGA Republicans try to pass a national ban on abortion, I will veto it. And consider that a promise made, and a promise will be kept.
Now, they're planning, beyond that, a national ban. The MAGA Republicans are saying there's going to be a national ban on abortion across every State in America—ban.
And by the way, I love how Trump is now saying, "Biden is for abortion on demand." Not true. That's not what Roe v. Wade said. It said there are three trimesters and how it worked.
Trump is bragging about how he overturned Roe v. Wade in the Supreme Court—a woman's right to choose. I'm a practicing Catholic. I don't want abortion on demand, but I thought Roe v. Wade had it right. The three trimesters, a doc should be part of it, and then a woman should have her choice early on.
Well, we're—they're now planning a national ban on the right to choose. They want every country—every State to get enough votes to say, "In my State—in my State, you cannot have an abortion under any circumstance, including whether it's rape, incest, or regardless of your age."
Today, in America, one in three women of reproductive age live in a State with an abortion ban. Since Roe was overturned, I have met women who have had miscarriages in toilets because they were refused care, women who went to an emergency room to receive care and were rejected because the health care providers there thought they would be sued and potentially sent to jail if they administered care. And it was only when she developed sepsis that she received care.
The President. No kidding. As they say in Claymont, Delaware, where I spent my childhood, "They ain't seen nothing yet." [Laughter] No, I'm serious though. Clearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade who support a national ban on abortion have no clue about the power of women. I mean it sincerely.
He brags about how he—he's the reason Roe v. Wade is overturned and the freedom to choose is taken away. Look, and American needs to know: Donald Trump and his MAGA extremists are now calling for a national ban—a national ban on abortion in every State in the Union.
Look, Trump is in trouble, and he knows it. Just today he released a video where he's scrambling on the abortion issue—scrambling on the issue. He's worried voters are going to hold him accountable for the—overturning Roe v. Wade and for the cruelty and chaos that it's created.
Well, the bad news is, for him, he bragged about overrowing [overturning; White House correction] Roe v. Wade. The voters are going to hold him accountable. Voters will hold him accountable in the—for the 14 States where abortion is now illegal in all cases, even rape or incest, because of—Roe v. Wade is no longer the law of the land.
The President. No, I need the abortion issue just to follow what's right.
Look, next week, one of the Nation's most extreme anti-abortion laws will take affect here in Florida. It's criminalizing reproductive health care for—before women even know whether they're pregnant. I mean, this is bizarre. I can put—you can put a doctor in prison if he takes care of a patient, as you just heard some version of from Louisiana.
Don't think he's making the deal right now with MAGA extremists to ban nationwide abortion in every single State, because he's making it. In fact, the MAGA majority in the House of Representatives has introduced three separate bans—three separate bans to choice—to ban choice nationwide—in every single State, based on the State—each State.
Earlier this week, I was in Florida, where they're about to implement one of the most extensive and extreme abortion bans in the country. There's only one reason and one person responsible: It's Donald Trump.
Trump is in trouble, and he knows that. Last week, I was in Florida, where today we're implementing—they're implementing the most extreme abortion bans in the country—one of them. He's only one—the only one person responsible is Donald Trump.
Today a 6-week ban in Florida. And then Trump did a long interview in TIME Magazine. I—it's coming out. You've got to read it. It's a mandatory reading. And he said in that magazine—he said States should monitor women's—now, get this: States should monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate abortion bans. Monitor women's pregnancies?
The President. ——monitor their pregnancies? He also said we should prosecute those who violate abortion bans.
Trump did a long interview, if you've seen it, in TIME magazine. If you haven't, I urge you to get it. Not a joke. He—his own words. He said, "States should monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate abortion bans." Monitor women's pregnancies? That's just what we need a President doing.
He said States should monitor women's pregnancies, prosecute those who violate abortion bans. Monitor women's pregnancies?
And look at what he says about reproductive freedom. He's bragging he's the reason Roe v. Wade was overturned. And he is, because of his appointments. Listen to what he said in TIME magazine article. He said States—quote—"States should monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate the abortion bans." Monitor women's pregnancies? Prosecute them?
And he says that the national abortion ban, they—this is the House—endorsed life as a—at moment of conception—no rape, no incest exceptions, and no bans—and he wants to ban even—they're talking about banning certain contraceptions.
These threats to abortion rights, to women's rights, to—even to birth control and IVF are not in our liberal imaginations anymore. They're very real. And these decisions—these very personal, intimate decisions are now being made by nine unelected judges, one of whom flies his flag upside down. The other one—one of the others drives around in a $267,000 gift on vacations.
BASH: This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. This morning, the court ruled on yet another abortion case, temporarily allowing emergency abortions to continue in Idaho, despite that state's restrictive ban.
Former President Trump, you take credit for the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which returned the issue of abortion to the states.
BASH: However, the federal government still plays a role in whether or not women have access to abortion pills. They're used in about two-thirds of all abortions.
As president, would you block abortion medication?
TRUMP: First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it.
As far as the abortion is concerned, it is now back with the states. The states are voting. In many cases, they – it's frankly a very liberal decision. In many cases, it's the opposite.
BASH: Staying on the topic of abortion, President Biden. Seven states –
Seven states have no legal restrictions on how far into a pregnancy a woman can obtain an abortion. Do you support any legal limits on how late a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy?
But we are not for late term abortion, period – period, period.
TRUMP: Under Roe v. Wade, you have late term abortion. You can do whatever you want, depending on the state. You can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing.
What's he going to do? What's he going to do, in fact, if – if the MAGA Republicans – he gets elected and the MAGA Republicans control of the Congress and they pass a universal ban on abortion, period, across the board, at six weeks, or seven, or eight or ten weeks, something very, very conservative. Is he going to sign that bill?
The President. We learned that if he's elected again and the MAGA Republicans pass a national ban on abortion, he will sign it.
In fact, the big takeaway are Trump's lies. I know the—I know what the Times did today, but they also pointed out he lied 28 times in 90 minutes. That's pretty good. [Laughter] But people remember the bad things were—[laughter]—during his Presidency, and I guess it reminded them of the past and why they didn't like him very much. They don't like chaos; they don't like extremism. And his answers on abortion and January 6 did a lot of damage to him and pointed out what we're trying to get done.
But the big takeaway were his lies. People remembered how bad things were during his Presidency, how much they disliked him. They don't like the chaos and extremism that he brought. His answer to abortion and January 6 did a lot of damage to his position—a lot of damage.
I want a country where women have a right to make their own health care decisions. Trump wants an America where abortion is banned and women are punished.
And here's the nightmare—it would—what it would unleash. Trump Project 2025 will criminalize the shipping of abortion medications—medication anywhere—anywhere to deny contraceptive covers [coverage; White House correction], allow a ban nationwide. That's what Project 2024 is—2024 is—25 is calling about.
They'd impose a nationwide ban on abortion. His new Vice President—you ever had any doubt, man, just take a look at what he's been saying.
And look, one of the things that's happening is—in almost, in the majority of the states, even conservative states where it's been left to the public to determine whether or not they wanna have no exceptions, they wanna have a hard call like, like Mance [sic. Vance] wants on “no abortion under any circumstance,” that there's, you have states saying no, no, no, that's not what we want to do. We want exceptions. So I think there is a—an ability—and the way we're gonna change it, if we get a Democratic Congress, all we gotta do is get 51 of those members of the House and Senate—a lot of the Senate—and say “this is it.” And then I'll sign that bill. What, what's gonna happen? Trump's gonna sign a bill if he gets elected, if we don't do well, that's gonna say we wipe it all on, no exceptions, nothing. None.
We who will fight for reproductive freedom, knowing if Trump gets the chance, he will sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every single State. But we are not going to let that happen.
And you know Trump will do everything to ban abortion nationwide.
The MAGA Republicans just cheered and embraced the first Supreme Court decision in our entire history—the first one in our entire history—that just didn't fail to preserve a constitutional freedom, it actually took away a fundamental right that had been granted by the same Court to so many Americans: the constitutional right to choose. And now nearly half the States in the United States of America have either passed a ban on abortion or will shortly. And in many States, abortion is already banned even in cases of rape and incest, a fundamental change.
Already, 166 House Republicans have signed on to a bill that would ban abortion nationwide. And the senior Senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, has proposed a national ban on abortion with criminal penalties put on doctors and put them in jail if they, in fact, violate the ban.
So, in 46 days, America is going to choose: If Republicans win control of the Congress, abortion will be banned. And by the way, it will be initially banned, but if they win Congress, I will veto it.
But if Republicans take control of the Congress, they're going to pass another ban. They want to have a national ban on abortion.
His position is extreme. For example, he's been down in Washington voting over and over again to defund Planned Parenthood. He's in the—and look, here's the bottom line: If Republicans gain control of Congress and pass a nationwide ban on abortion, I will veto it. And if we elect—they give me two more Democrats in the Senate and we keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January and make it the law of the land.
The President. If you elect Wes your Governor, he's going to make sure the right to choose is protected for every woman in Maryland. If Republicans gain control of Congress and pass a nationwide ban on abortion, I will veto it. And, folks, if we elect Chris Van Hollen and elect two more Democrats and keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January and make it the rule of the land.
And I want to be very clear: Under no circumstances will I support the proposal put forward by Senators Johnson and the Senator from down in Florida to cut or make fundamental changes in Social Security and Medicare. That's not on the table. I will not do that. I will veto any attempt to pass a national ban on abortion.
The President. Congress must restore the right that was taken away in Roe v. Wade and protect Roe v. Wade. Give every woman the constitutional right. The Vice President and I are doing everything to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient safety. But already, more than a dozen States are enforcing extreme abortion bans.
And what's really remarkable is despite the will of the American people, MAGA Republicans have made clear that they don't intend to stop with the Dobbs decision. No, they won't, until they get a national ban on abortion. Speaker McCarthy said, quote, "Our work is far from done." End of quote. Senator Lindsey Graham wants to——
The President. ——wants to criminalize doctors and nurses who provide medical care for their patients; make it a crime. Republicans in Congress have proposed three national abortion bans just this last year. Well, make no mistake about it: If somehow Congress were to pass a national ban, I will veto it.
I signed legislation increasing funding for childcare and development block grants by 30 percent, helping low-income families afford childcare. But there's so much more to do. And we're fighting over abortion?
So let's be absolutely clear what Trump is bragging about. The reason there are 21 States where abortion bans are in effect, may [many; White House correction] with no exception for rape or any other—or incest, is Donald Trump.
The President. And frankly, Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, including the Speaker of the House, are hell-bent on going even further. To date, MAGA Republicans in Congress have proposed three additional national abortion bans to criminalize health care in every State.
But as long as I have the power of the Presidency, know this: If Congress were to pass a national abortion ban, I will veto it. I will veto it.
BASH: This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. This morning, the court ruled on yet another abortion case, temporarily allowing emergency abortions to continue in Idaho, despite that state's restrictive ban.
Former President Trump, you take credit for the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which returned the issue of abortion to the states.
BASH: However, the federal government still plays a role in whether or not women have access to abortion pills. They're used in about two-thirds of all abortions.
As president, would you block abortion medication?
TRUMP: First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it.
As far as the abortion is concerned, it is now back with the states. The states are voting. In many cases, they – it's frankly a very liberal decision. In many cases, it's the opposite.
BASH: Staying on the topic of abortion, President Biden. Seven states –
Seven states have no legal restrictions on how far into a pregnancy a woman can obtain an abortion. Do you support any legal limits on how late a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy?
But we are not for late term abortion, period – period, period.
TRUMP: Under Roe v. Wade, you have late term abortion. You can do whatever you want, depending on the state. You can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing.
What's he going to do? What's he going to do, in fact, if – if the MAGA Republicans – he gets elected and the MAGA Republicans control of the Congress and they pass a universal ban on abortion, period, across the board, at six weeks, or seven, or eight or ten weeks, something very, very conservative. Is he going to sign that bill?
The President. We learned that if he's elected again and the MAGA Republicans pass a national ban on abortion, he will sign it.
I want a country where women have a right to make their own health care decisions. Trump wants an America where abortion is banned and women are punished.
They'd impose a nationwide ban on abortion. His new Vice President—you ever had any doubt, man, just take a look at what he's been saying.
The President. Right to privacy, it's not just abortion rights. But yes, abortion rights.
And your views on abortion have evolved in your public life. Are you the best messenger to carry this forward when Democrats—many of them, many progressives—want you to do more? [Laughter]
So how extreme are these MAGA Republicans? Just take a look what happened since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. In red States after red State, there's a race to pass the most restrictive abortion limitations imaginable, even without exception for rape or incest.
Well, just take a look at what's happened since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. In 14 States, abortion is not available beyond 6 weeks of pregnancy, when most women don't even know they are pregnant. In most of these States, there is no exception for rape or incest. In the coming weeks and months, another 13 States may ban abortion depending on the outcome of this election in November—another 13.
That means, in just weeks and months, more than half of America will have banned abortion if we don't win this off-year election. And they're not going to stop there. If they win control of the House and Senate, they've made it clear: They're going to try to pass a national ban. But as long as I'm President, they ain't going to get it done, because I'll veto it.
And here's the deal. Guess what? On choice, Democrats want to codify Roe—not what you have—what you have on the ballot. Republicans want a national ban on abortion. In fact, Gretchen's opponent supports an extreme ban with no exceptions for rape or incest or the life of the mother. Gretchen supports the ballot initiative to put the right to reproductive freedom in your State constitution.
The MAGA Republicans just cheered and embraced the first Supreme Court decision in our entire history—the first one in our entire history—that just didn't fail to preserve a constitutional freedom, it actually took away a fundamental right that had been granted by the same Court to so many Americans: the constitutional right to choose. And now nearly half the States in the United States of America have either passed a ban on abortion or will shortly. And in many States, abortion is already banned even in cases of rape and incest, a fundamental change.

So, in 46 days, America is going to choose: If Republicans win control of the Congress, abortion will be banned. And by the way, it will be initially banned, but if they win Congress, I will veto it.
And so, you know—and whether or not it's—on choice, you know, I—as I've said when this decision was handed down, you know, it's not going to just be the issue of abortion. It's going to be contraception. And you're already seeing that debate taking place in States where they're trying to outlaw the ability of people—there was a famous case, Griswold v. Connecticut, where, in the late sixties—that the Supreme Court said, in the privacy of their own bedroom, a man and woman should be able to choose whether or not they can use contraception and is—it's not the government's business, because they had outlawed the use of contraception.
And I want to be very clear: Under no circumstances will I support the proposal put forward by Senators Johnson and the Senator from down in Florida to cut or make fundamental changes in Social Security and Medicare. That's not on the table. I will not do that. I will veto any attempt to pass a national ban on abortion.
And one more thing: If Republicans pass—and I got—don't think they can do it now—a ban—a national ban to ban abortion, I will veto it. It's simple. We need to codify Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.
The President. Congress must restore the right that was taken away in Roe v. Wade and protect Roe v. Wade. Give every woman the constitutional right. The Vice President and I are doing everything to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient safety. But already, more than a dozen States are enforcing extreme abortion bans.
And by the way, I love how Trump is now saying, "Biden is for abortion on demand." Not true. That's not what Roe v. Wade said. It said there are three trimesters and how it worked.
Today, in America, one in three women of reproductive age live in a State with an abortion ban. Since Roe was overturned, I have met women who have had miscarriages in toilets because they were refused care, women who went to an emergency room to receive care and were rejected because the health care providers there thought they would be sued and potentially sent to jail if they administered care. And it was only when she developed sepsis that she received care.
The President. No kidding. As they say in Claymont, Delaware, where I spent my childhood, "They ain't seen nothing yet." [Laughter] No, I'm serious though. Clearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade who support a national ban on abortion have no clue about the power of women. I mean it sincerely.
Trump brags about how he's the reason Roe v. Wade was overturned, the freedom to choose was taken away. Americans needs to know Trump—Donald Trump and his MAGA extremists—extremists are not calling for a national—are now calling for a national ban on all abortions.
He brags about how he—he's the reason Roe v. Wade is overturned and the freedom to choose is taken away. Look, and American needs to know: Donald Trump and his MAGA extremists are now calling for a national ban—a national ban on abortion in every State in the Union.
Look, Trump is in trouble, and he knows it. Just today he released a video where he's scrambling on the abortion issue—scrambling on the issue. He's worried voters are going to hold him accountable for the—overturning Roe v. Wade and for the cruelty and chaos that it's created.
Well, the bad news is, for him, he bragged about overrowing [overturning; White House correction] Roe v. Wade. The voters are going to hold him accountable. Voters will hold him accountable in the—for the 14 States where abortion is now illegal in all cases, even rape or incest, because of—Roe v. Wade is no longer the law of the land.
Earlier this week, I was in Florida, where they're about to implement one of the most extensive and extreme abortion bans in the country. There's only one reason and one person responsible: It's Donald Trump.
And here's the deal. Guess what? On choice, Democrats want to codify Roe—not what you have—what you have on the ballot. Republicans want a national ban on abortion. In fact, Gretchen's opponent supports an extreme ban with no exceptions for rape or incest or the life of the mother. Gretchen supports the ballot initiative to put the right to reproductive freedom in your State constitution.
So if the United States Congress and the President were to sign a law saying, "We outlaw abortion under any circumstance," it's the law of the land under the Supreme Court ruling. We're going to do the opposite. We're going to make sure Roe v. Wade becomes the law of the land.
So let's be absolutely clear what Trump is bragging about. The reason there are 21 States where abortion bans are in effect, may [many; White House correction] with no exception for rape or any other—or incest, is Donald Trump.
The President. And frankly, Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, including the Speaker of the House, are hell-bent on going even further. To date, MAGA Republicans in Congress have proposed three additional national abortion bans to criminalize health care in every State.
But as long as I have the power of the Presidency, know this: If Congress were to pass a national abortion ban, I will veto it. I will veto it.
These threats to abortion rights, to women's rights, to—even to birth control and IVF are not in our liberal imaginations anymore. They're very real. And these decisions—these very personal, intimate decisions are now being made by nine unelected judges, one of whom flies his flag upside down. The other one—one of the others drives around in a $267,000 gift on vacations.

And your views on abortion have evolved in your public life. Are you the best messenger to carry this forward when Democrats—many of them, many progressives—want you to do more? [Laughter]
Mayor O'Neal. Well, I think that you can primarily list—I think one of my colleagues here this morning mentioned Viagra. If you start to talk about taking away the rights of men to take it, then what do we have? Or if we think about the fact that there are medical procedures that men can have as well—because an abortion is a medical procedure—there are medical procedures that men can have that will help them not to contribute to the making of a child.
County Judge Lina Hidalgo of Harris County, TX. Mr. President, as you know, I'm a county executive in Houston. And it was tragic: Just yesterday the trigger law in Texas came into effect. And it means that abortion is banned from the time of fertilization and that anyone who performs an abortion could be charged with a felony, and the penalty could be up to life in prison. And so, as we celebrate Women's Equality Day, we have everything but equality when it comes to this issue.
I'm hearing a lot of concern from our doctors in the community. Our public hospital system provides abortions when they're medically necessary. And those doctors are telling us they're not going to be able to determine anymore when it is legal to provide an abortion, because the law in Texas has no exemptions for rape or incest; only allows an abortion exception when the life of the mother is in danger or they're at danger of irreparable harm.
And we've got to change it, as you say, at the ballot box. But look, we have that, we have a bounty law, and we have a legislative session that's going to start in January where they're looking at tackling contraception—access to contraception. They're already talked about banning that—banning the pill that helps women seek abortion who can't make it to a clinic physically; that would make it even harder for women to travel.
A woman in Houston would have to travel 600 miles to get to the nearest abortion clinic in New Mexico. And so we need help figuring out how to get women to be able to seek that abortion, to travel to these States that are offering us safe havens.
And I want to be very clear: Under no circumstances will I support the proposal put forward by Senators Johnson and the Senator from down in Florida to cut or make fundamental changes in Social Security and Medicare. That's not on the table. I will not do that. I will veto any attempt to pass a national ban on abortion.
