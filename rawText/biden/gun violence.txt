The President. I spent a lot of time with this guy—Mayor Mike Duggan—and Police Chief James White. Are—they're using these ARP funds to modernize police training facilities, to invest in retention of police officers, gun violence prevention efforts, gunshot detection technology.
In Baton Rouge—Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Police Chief Murphy Pearl—Paul—excuse me—is using ARP funds to purchase 200 additional patrol cars while investing $3 million to implement proven strategy to reduce gun violence in communities, to produce prevention programs. In Tampa, Mayor Jane Castor and Mayor—and the police chief, Mary O'Connor, they're using ARP funds to modernize the city's fire prevention capacity, including with new fire vehicles. In Toledo, Ohio, Mayor Wade is using the ARP funds not only to avoid layoffs, but to add 100 police officers in the next few years.
Your right to choose is on the ballot this year. The Social Security you paid for from the time you had a job is on the ballot. The safety of your kids from gun violence is on the ballot. And it's not hyperbole, the very survival of our planet is on the ballot. Your right to vote is on the ballot. Even the democracy.
Your safety of your kids from gun violence is on the ballot. The survival of our planet is literally on the ballot. Your right to vote—even our democracy—is on the ballot. Are you ready to fight for these things? Not to—I really mean it. We need to do everything we can to get folks organized, mobilized, and vote, vote, vote, vote!
The safety of kids and gun violence—from gun violence is on the ballot. Our kids should be going to school learning how to read and write, not how to duck and cover.
Gun safety for our kids and gun violence are on the ballot. The idea that you start school this year and kids in many parts of the country learn how to duck and cover rather than—no, I'm serious; think about it—rather than talking about reading, writing, and arithmetic is a very different circumstance. It's not right. It's not who we are. It's not who we should be.
You know, the whole idea of gun safety. You know, you pick up the paper every—I don't have to tell the Governor this; he's forgotten more about this than most people are ever going to know. But you know, you have these constant, constant examples of gun violence.
And I especially want to thank the young people of this Nation, who—I'm told; I haven't seen the numbers—voted in historic numbers again and—just as they did 2 years ago. They voted to continue addressing the climate crisis, gun violence, their personal rights and freedoms, and the student debt relief.
We saw extraordinary results in these midterms elections that no one thought possible. More Independents voted for Democrats and Republicans in this election. Young people, you voted at historic numbers again, just as you did 2 years ago. Young people voted to continue addressing the climate crisis, gun violence, personal rights and freedoms, student debt relief, all those things which you stepped up to do.
That was the plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde—I met with every one of them—"Do something about gun violence." Thank God—thank God—we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.
And the one State I don't have to talk about gun violence in is here. I've been hearing the tragic times that occurred here in this State.
Imagine what we could do—from everything from the deficit to taking care of kids, education, so many—I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.
We've made historic investments in rebuilding the country, in computer chips, combating climate change, gun violence. But the first—I put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, as I promised I'd do. And I could go on.
Where working people finally get a fair shot, where health care is a right, not a privilege—a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence. These aren't crazy ideas. These are basic ideas that the vast majority of American people agree with.
We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence, and that's why we will work to pass universal background checks, "red flag" laws, and an assault weapons ban.
And, folks, the distinguished Senator from—deceased Senator from California and I passed the first ban on assault weapons. And guess what? It worked. If we care about public safety, we need to prevent gun violence.
You know, we're joined today by the Attorney General, Merrick Garland, who I've asked to prioritize gun violence. It's also good to see the Second Gentleman, who is here. And it's good to see the First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden, who cares deeply about this issue as well.
So I'm here to talk about two things: First, the steps we're going to take immediately, and, second, the action that needs to be taken going forward to curb the epidemic of gun violence.
But there are proven strategies that reduce gun violence in urban communities, and there are programs that have demonstrated they can reduce homicides by up to 60 percent in urban communities. But many of these have been badly underfunded or not funded at all of late.
Gun violence in America—for those of you who think of this from an economic standpoint listening to me—estimated to cost the Nation $280 billion—let me say it again—$280 billion a year. They said, "How could that be, Joe?" Hospital bills, physical therapy, trauma counseling, legal fees, prison costs, and the loss of productivity. Not to mention the psychological damage done to the children who live in these cities, watching this happen, knowing someone it happened to. This gun violence in our neighborhood is having a profound impact on our children, even if they're never involved in pulling the trigger or being the victim of—on the other side of a trigger.
For a fraction of the cost of gun violence, we can save lives, create safe and healthy communities, and build economies that work for all of us and save billions of American dollars in the meantime, much of it, as Senator Cicilline knows, is taxpayer money.
And I've said before: My job, the job of any President, is to protect the American people. Whether Congress acts or not, I'm going to use all the resources at my disposal as President to keep the American people safe from gun violence. But there's much more that Congress can do to help that effort. And they can do it right now.
They've offered plenty of thoughts and prayers—Members of Congress—but they've passed not a single new Federal law to reduce gun violence. Enough prayers. Time for some action.
These are some of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence and save lives. But all these bills, they had support of both Democrats and Republicans in the House. And universal background checks are supported by the vast majority of the American people and, I might add, the vast majority of responsible gun owners.
The idea that we have so many people dying every single day from gun violence in America is a blemish on our character as nation.
Let me say to all of you: God bless you, but most importantly, the memory of all many of you have lost to this senseless gun violence.
And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America. The flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. And, in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America—250 shot dead.
More than 2 weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know—the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence—I laid out several of the Department of Justice actions that are being taken to impact on this epidemic.
And I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it's time for Congress to act as well. Look, I don't want to become confrontational, but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democratic colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don't tell me it can't be done. We did it before, and it worked.
On May 7, we issued a proposed rule to help address the proliferation of ghost guns. On June 7, we issued a proposed rule to clarify that pistols equipped with certain stabilizing braces are subject to the same statutory restrictions as easily concealable, short-barreled rifles. And on the same day, the Department published model Extreme Risk Protection Order legislation for States to consider as they craft their own laws to reduce gun violence.
And we just met, as a I said, with a bipartisan group of mayors, law enforcement, and community leaders. And we discussed a comprehensive strategy that I'm releasing today to combat the epidemic of gun violence and other violent crime that we've been seeing in our country for far too long, that has spiked since the start of the pandemic over a year ago.
For folks at home, here's what you need to know: I've been at this a long time, and there are things we know that work that reduce gun violence and violent crime and things that we don't know about. But things we know about: Background checks for purchasing a firearm are important; a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines—no one needs to have a weapon that can fire over 30, 40, 50, even up to 100 rounds unless you think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests or something; community policing and programs that keep neighborhoods safe and keep folks out of trouble.
These efforts work. They save lives. But over time, these policies were gutted and are woefully underfunded. In our conversation today, we talked about our strategy to supercharge what works while we continue to push the Congress to act on sensible gun violence legislation.
Second, we discussed disrupting illegal gun trafficking. Now, the gun lobby wants you to believe that cities that are the toughest gun—have the toughest gun laws still have the highest rates of gun violence, as was pointed out by the group we had today in our roundtable. They—the violence is so—they argue, "Why do you need those gun laws if they don't work in cities that have tough laws?" Don't believe it.
And amid the COVID-19 pandemic, they've had to deal with a second public health crisis: gun violence. The American Rescue Plan, which we passed in the first hundred days of my administration, is providing much-needed, historic relief to bring back those law enforcement jobs and social service jobs.
Much of this relief has already arrived. The rest is on its way. And we're now providing more guidance on how they can use the $350 billion nationally that the American Rescue Plan has available to help reduce crime and address the root causes. For example, cities experiencing an increase in gun violence were able to use the American Rescue Plan dollars to hire police officers needed for community policing and to pay their overtime.
Mayors will also be able to buy crime-fighting technologies, like gunshot detection systems, to better see and stop gun violence in their communities. They can use the funding to scale up wraparound services for the residents as well, including substance abuse and mental health services that we know will make a difference to prevention of crime.
Attorney General Grewal of New Jersey and Mayor Daniel—and Mayor Daniella Levine Cava of Miami-Dade talked about their efforts to lift up those kinds of—their—the kinds of community programs that reduce gun violence, keep communities safe, and make real, positive difference in people's lives.
Eddie was formerly incarcerated for gun homicide, and DeVone lost his brother to gun violence. And Eddie worked as a violence interrupter. Now he runs a program that provides high-risk men with cognitive behavioral therapy to help them react to the impulses by slowing down rather than following through on the violence. It puts them in—he puts them in paid jobs to change their trajectory. The program has reduced shootings by 40 percent.
DeVone runs a program across California and six other States that enroll high-risk individuals in peace fellowships, complete with intensive mentoring and social services. It's saving lives. In Sacramento, for example, 91 percent of participants stayed away from gun violence.
As Vice President, I pushed hard to lift the freeze on gun violence research at the C—the Center for Disease Control, the CDC. Guess what? Why should they not be able to study gun violence and what causes it? But there's been a block on it. I want to unfreeze that. As President, my budget doubles funding for the gun violence research at the CDC and the National Institutes of Health—the NIH—to study gun violence as a public health threat that it is.
And we need to keep building on the gun violence and crime-prevention strategy we're laying out today. Folks, this shouldn't be a red or blue issue, it's an American issue. We're not changing the Constitution; we're enforcing it, being reasonable. We're taking on the bad actors doing bad and dangerous things to our communities and to our country.
But the purpose of the meeting today is, we've convened a group of law enforcement and other community leaders, including mayors of the—of our cities: one, to thank them for their service because we owe them big time; second, to hear directly from each of them about reducing violent crime and, particularly, gun violence in their communities.
We recognize that we have to come together to fulfill the first responsibility of a democracy, and that's keep each other safe. And that's what the American people are looking for when it comes to reducing violent crime and gun violence.
Mr. Lemon. Mr. President, I want to talk about something else that affects people a lot, and to children as well. The next question—and it's about gun violence. This is from a paralegal, and she's an advocate. Her name is Andrea Solis Canto. She's a Democrat.
So how will you address gun violence, from a Federal point of view, to actually bring about change and make our local cities safer?
The President. Now, I'm not being a wise guy. There's no reason you should—have you seen my gun violence legislation I've introduced? As you know—because you're so involved—actually, crime is down; gun violence and murder rates are up. Guns. I'm the only guy that ever got passed legislation, when I was a Senator, that made sure we eliminated assault weapons. The idea you need a weapon that can have the ability to fire 20, 30, 40, 50, 120 shots from that weapon—whether it's a 9-millimeter pistol or whether it's a rifle—is ridiculous.
Number two—number two—we're in a position where you—most of the cities—and I don't know enough—I think you've had a lot of gun violence here in Cincinnati. I think it was up to—what?—how many how dead? Five hundred over a period. Don't hold me to the number—whatever it was. But my point is, all across the country. And it's not because the gun shops in the cities are selling these guns. They are either shadow gun dealers and/or gun shops that are not abiding by the law.
We're also working to stem the flow of firearms and rogue gun dealers to curb epidemics of gun violence in this country. No greater victims than the Black communities. We talk about these massive shootings. Well, guess what? There's a massive shooting every day in urban America, the number of lives that are taken.
And—but the American Rescue Plan gives us the resources to do many of those things. And, you know, there's a lot of challenges out there that we're not even talking to directly; today, there's so many. But the surge of gun violence since the start of this pandemic.
And every day in this country, 316 people are shot, 106 are killed. And six NYPD officers have been victims of gun violence so far, just this year—the same in the town north of me, Philadelphia; and my much smaller town of Wilmington, Delaware; and Washington, DC. Sixty-four children injured by gun violence so far this year, twenty-six killed. It's enough. Enough is enough.
In the next year's budget, I'm also going to try to double down on this investment. I think I got a lot of partners here in New York that are going to help. Mayor Adams, you say that gun violence is a sea fed by many rivers. Well, the—you know, I put forward a plan to dam up some of those streams.
That's why, today, the Attorney General is also directing U.S. attorneys to work with State and local law enforcement to strengthen partnerships like this one and to get repeat gun violence offenders off the street and behind bars.
The President. It's to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them. Fund them with the resources and training—resources and training they need to protect our communities. I ask Democrats and Republicans alike to pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe. And we'll do everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking of ghost guns that you can buy online, assemble at home—no serial numbers, can't be traced. I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on the terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon. Why? Why?
If you commit a crime with a ghost gun, expect Federal prosecution, not just State. Expect Federal prosecution. This rule is an important step. It's going to make a difference, I promise you. And there are a lot of other things we know work to reduce gun violence and other violent crimes and save lives.
That's why I've put together a comprehensive strategy to supercharge what works while continuing to push Congress to act on sensible legislation to prevent gun violence.
And I've already made clear that I want cities, States, counties, and Tribes to use some of the $350 billion we sent to them in the American Rescue Plan—that I wrote in the first month—to reduce gun violence, hire police officers for community policing, pay police overtime, purchase crime-fighting technologies. They were given the money. They can do it. Spend it.
And last and certainly not least, I have partnered with the ATF for decades in its crucial fight against gun violence. You know, whether it was taking a single violent recidivist off the street in Maryland or putting together a big racketeering case against a violent gang in Youngstown, Ohio, I have seen the ATF work with other law enforcement to make so many of our communities safer.
The President. I spent a lot of time with this guy—Mayor Mike Duggan—and Police Chief James White. Are—they're using these ARP funds to modernize police training facilities, to invest in retention of police officers, gun violence prevention efforts, gunshot detection technology.
In Baton Rouge—Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Police Chief Murphy Pearl—Paul—excuse me—is using ARP funds to purchase 200 additional patrol cars while investing $3 million to implement proven strategy to reduce gun violence in communities, to produce prevention programs. In Tampa, Mayor Jane Castor and Mayor—and the police chief, Mary O'Connor, they're using ARP funds to modernize the city's fire prevention capacity, including with new fire vehicles. In Toledo, Ohio, Mayor Wade is using the ARP funds not only to avoid layoffs, but to add 100 police officers in the next few years.
And it's working. More than 300 communities, from big cities to small towns, are using more than $10 billion of American Rescue Plan funds for violence prevention and public safety this year: building new police training facilities; recruiting, which is getting harder; hiring; and giving policemen a raise; partnering with the Federal, State, and local community groups to reduce gun violence; investing in community interventions that use trusted community members to work directly with people who are most likely to commit gun crimes or become the victims of gun crimes and intervene before it's too late.
My plan also takes commonsense action to reduce gun violence and violence overall. It builds on the progress we made this summer when I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun safety law we passed in 30 years. It took 30 years.
Law enforcement supported it. Faith leaders and teachers supported it. Victims of gun violence and their families supported it. Young people in this country, like the students of the great—this great university, support it.
Gun safety for our kids and gun violence are on the ballot. The idea that you start school this year and kids in many parts of the country learn how to duck and cover rather than—no, I'm serious; think about it—rather than talking about reading, writing, and arithmetic is a very different circumstance. It's not right. It's not who we are. It's not who we should be.
And I especially want to thank the young people of this Nation, who—I'm told; I haven't seen the numbers—voted in historic numbers again and—just as they did 2 years ago. They voted to continue addressing the climate crisis, gun violence, their personal rights and freedoms, and the student debt relief.
Our prayers are with the people of Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay, and after yet another spree of gun violence in America.
That was the plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde—I met with every one of them—"Do something about gun violence." Thank God—thank God—we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.
The day after, we stood here in the East Room with Steph Curry, an NBA Champion who is a supporter of the—and the Golden—champion Golden State Warriors that continue the storied tradition of Black athletes playing a role bigger than just the game they play: speaking out against racism; standing up for equality; encouraging people to vote; empowering children and their families to eat healthy, learn and play in safe places; rallying the country against gun violence.
The same goes for Senator Dick Blumenthal, a great friend. He was attorney general when my deceased son was attorney general of Delaware. Another leader in the fight against gun violence.
The facts give us reason to hope though. So far this year, murder is down in many major cities across the country. There's far too much gun violence, but that's why this summit is so important and why Chris asked me to be here today with the following message.
More people die from gun violence as a consequence of suicide than anything else that happens in the Nation. Suicide. This legislation has already delivered more than $1.5 billion to States and communities to make schools safer, improve access to mental health services, and help young people deal with the grief and trauma resulting from gun violence, posttraumatic stress syndrome.
All told, we've taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any of my predecessors—probably than all my predecessors. They're being challenged in court, but so far, so good. [Laughter]
Look, ladies and gentlemen, for those who say they're concerned about crime, you can't deal with crime without dealing with gun violence. It's a simple proposition.
Look, let me close with this. I know many people here who have been impacted by gun violence, lost someone they loved, fought so hard for so many years. A lot of you are tired.
And I do believe the right to be safe is also a civil right. Today, however, gun violence is the number-one cause of death for children in America. But instead of protecting our children, extremists obstruct.
With your support, I also signed the first gun safety law in 30 years. And we're working with you to implement it, to coordinate these efforts and create the first-ever White House Office—I—we—what we did, my staff came along and said, you know, we need a White House Office dedicated to getting guns off the street and threatening—and treating the trauma from gun violence, because there's a lot of trauma as a consequence.
And finally, my plan goes after the scourge of gun violence in America. I've taken more executive actions to stop the flow of illegal guns than any other administration in history. And we beat the NRA when I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years.
Tonight you've heard mine. I see a future where [we're; White House correction] defending democracy, you don't diminish it. I see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect our freedoms, not take them away. I see a future where the middle class has—finally has a fair shot and the wealthy have to pay their fair share in taxes. I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.
And I see a future where the planet moves from the climate crisis and our country away from the gun violence that we have so much of. I see a future where America remains the beacon of the world.
In this moment, we see extremists who try to divide our Nation. We see so-called leaders with the biggest pulpits and the biggest bully pulpits who encourage and incite xenophobia and hate, including anti-Asian hate. We see a full-on assault, State by State, on our most fundamental freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote, the freedom to live safe from the horror of gun violence, the freedom from hate and bigotry, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history, and the freedom of women to make decisions about their own body—and not have their government tell them what to do.
Julvonnia, I know from experience it takes extraordinary courage for you to stand up here and retell your son's story—and many of you who have lost someone to gun violence. It's been a passion of mine for a long, long time.
But the fact of the matter is, I remember well when you first started it with me—this extraordinary courage. You know, through your words, you help ensure that your son and all the victims of gun violence are not forgotten. They didn't die in vain. Through your love, you help prevent the next tragedy. It saves lives.
Audience member. Thank you for honoring gun violence survivors!
It was designed to reduce gun violence and save lives. And I'm so proud of the tremendous progress we've made since then.
Folks, look, third, the act invests over $1 billion, the largest one-time investment ever in mental health—youth mental health in our schools to help them deal with grief and trauma resulting in gun violence. I've attended too many mass shootings—I've—have gone to too many schools across America and stood there and looked at the faces of those young children who were—made it and look at all the families that lost somebody. It's tragic. But it needs help. They need help to get through it.
That's why, last September, I established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. [Applause] And I mean it. We've got first-rate professionals there and overseen by my incredible Vice President—who is a pretty fierce prosecutor as well—to drive and coordinate government and nationwide effort to reduce gun violence in America. That's why we did it. And to send a clear message about how important this issue is to me, to you, and to the entire country.
Folks, you're changing the Nation. You really are. You're changing the Nation. It builds upon the dozen of executive actions my administration has taken to reduce gun violence—more than any of my predecessors, and I suspect more than all of them combined—everything from cracking down on ghost guns, gun trafficking, and so much more.
And above all—above all—we all agree: We are not finished. Look, no single—no single—action can solve the entirety of the gun violence epidemic. But together, our efforts, your efforts are saving lives.
Let me close with this. I know many people here have been impacted by gun violence and are tired and frustrated. [Applause] No—no, I know. I've been to too many—I've literally spoken with well over a thousand families at these events that I've attended for mass shootings. And the look in their eyes—you can almost—you can almost feel that black hole they feel in the center of their chest, like they're being sucked in, there's no way out. And if they have remaining children, you look at the children, and they wonder, "Mommy, Daddy, how about me?"
And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America. The flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. And, in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America—250 shot dead.
More than 2 weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know—the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence—I laid out several of the Department of Justice actions that are being taken to impact on this epidemic.
And I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it's time for Congress to act as well. Look, I don't want to become confrontational, but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democratic colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don't tell me it can't be done. We did it before, and it worked.
And that empathy—empathy—is the fuel of democracy, the willingness to see each other as opponents, not as enemies. Above all, to see each other as fellow Americans even when we disagree. From John's perspective, especially when we disagreed. That's how John forged consensus and made sure our system worked and delivered for the people. I saw it time and again on issues of war and peace. John opposing torture and ending gun violence; on protecting the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.
We're going to continue to stand up to meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate change, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more.
My plan also takes commonsense action to reduce gun violence and violence overall. It builds on the progress we made this summer when I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun safety law we passed in 30 years. It took 30 years.

DeVone runs a program across California and six other States that enroll high-risk individuals in peace fellowships, complete with intensive mentoring and social services. It's saving lives. In Sacramento, for example, 91 percent of participants stayed away from gun violence.
As Vice President, I pushed hard to lift the freeze on gun violence research at the C—the Center for Disease Control, the CDC. Guess what? Why should they not be able to study gun violence and what causes it? But there's been a block on it. I want to unfreeze that. As President, my budget doubles funding for the gun violence research at the CDC and the National Institutes of Health—the NIH—to study gun violence as a public health threat that it is.
And we need to keep building on the gun violence and crime-prevention strategy we're laying out today. Folks, this shouldn't be a red or blue issue, it's an American issue. We're not changing the Constitution; we're enforcing it, being reasonable. We're taking on the bad actors doing bad and dangerous things to our communities and to our country.
Mr. Lemon. Mr. President, I want to talk about something else that affects people a lot, and to children as well. The next question—and it's about gun violence. This is from a paralegal, and she's an advocate. Her name is Andrea Solis Canto. She's a Democrat.
So how will you address gun violence, from a Federal point of view, to actually bring about change and make our local cities safer?
The President. Now, I'm not being a wise guy. There's no reason you should—have you seen my gun violence legislation I've introduced? As you know—because you're so involved—actually, crime is down; gun violence and murder rates are up. Guns. I'm the only guy that ever got passed legislation, when I was a Senator, that made sure we eliminated assault weapons. The idea you need a weapon that can have the ability to fire 20, 30, 40, 50, 120 shots from that weapon—whether it's a 9-millimeter pistol or whether it's a rifle—is ridiculous.
Number two—number two—we're in a position where you—most of the cities—and I don't know enough—I think you've had a lot of gun violence here in Cincinnati. I think it was up to—what?—how many how dead? Five hundred over a period. Don't hold me to the number—whatever it was. But my point is, all across the country. And it's not because the gun shops in the cities are selling these guns. They are either shadow gun dealers and/or gun shops that are not abiding by the law.
We need to work together to confront the epidemic of gun violence. Your brothers and sisters have told me over the years, sometimes, you feel like you're "outgunned." Right now the Justice Department, under the leadership of Attorney General Garland, is working with State and local law enforcement across the country to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals.
We're also working to stem the flow of firearms from rogue gun dealers to curb the epidemic of gun violence. I know I get criticized for being the guy who passed the assault weapons ban. I'm proud of having passed the assault weapons ban.
These grants, which total nearly $140 million, will go to 183 law enforcement agencies and allow them to fund over 1,000 new law enforcement positions and to fund other initiatives to build legitimacy and trust in communities, to address gun violence and other violent crimes, and to combat hate and domestic extremism, and to enhance the response to people in crisis.
We're talking about programs like violence interrupters, who work as a complement to police in identifying those most likely to be involved in gun violence, stopping it from happening to begin, and put those at risk—who put those people at risk, and put them on a better road to life so we can—we get them—we divert them before they get into the bad stream to begin with. And I want to thank the folks in front of me for doing that. And I want to thank the Attorney General—Attorney General Garland—for leading these efforts as well.
And—but the American Rescue Plan gives us the resources to do many of those things. And, you know, there's a lot of challenges out there that we're not even talking to directly; today, there's so many. But the surge of gun violence since the start of this pandemic.
And every day in this country, 316 people are shot, 106 are killed. And six NYPD officers have been victims of gun violence so far, just this year—the same in the town north of me, Philadelphia; and my much smaller town of Wilmington, Delaware; and Washington, DC. Sixty-four children injured by gun violence so far this year, twenty-six killed. It's enough. Enough is enough.
In the next year's budget, I'm also going to try to double down on this investment. I think I got a lot of partners here in New York that are going to help. Mayor Adams, you say that gun violence is a sea fed by many rivers. Well, the—you know, I put forward a plan to dam up some of those streams.
That's why, today, the Attorney General is also directing U.S. attorneys to work with State and local law enforcement to strengthen partnerships like this one and to get repeat gun violence offenders off the street and behind bars.
The President. It's to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them. Fund them with the resources and training—resources and training they need to protect our communities. I ask Democrats and Republicans alike to pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe. And we'll do everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking of ghost guns that you can buy online, assemble at home—no serial numbers, can't be traced. I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on the terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon. Why? Why?
We're going to continue to stand up to meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate change, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more.
The President. No, no, I'm serious. Think of what they—and they're saying. They're not kidding about it. And we haven't even talked about voting rights and gun violence and criminal justice, immigration. All things—and we just have—you know, the good news is we have 50 Senators and the Vice President. And the bad news is, there are 51 Presidents. [Laughter] Any one can declare themselves President, as two Democrats have.
The Vice President and I, as I said, met a little bit earlier, just before this, with leaders from the Asian American community here in Georgia. We talked about Tuesday's mass shooting, about another example of public health crisis, of gun violence in this country. Eight people killed, seven women. Six were of Asian descent. All fellow Americans. Each one of them we mourn.
But I do know this: As President, I can use all the resources at my disposal to keep the American people safe. As I said: At this moment, a great deal remains unknown. But three things are certain. First, 10 lives have been lost, and more families have been shattered by gun violence in the State of Colorado. And Jill and I are devastated. And the feeling—I just can't imagine how the families are feeling—the victims whose futures were stolen from them, from their families, from their loved ones who now have to struggle to go on and try to make sense of what's happened.
Less than a week after the horrific murders of eight people and the assault on the AAPI community in Georgia, while the flag was still flying halfstaff for the tragedy, another American city has been scarred by gun violence and the resulting trauma.
We can close the loopholes in our background check system, including the "Charleston loophole." That's one of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence. The Senate should immediately pass—let me say it again: The United States Senate—I hope some are listening—should immediately pass the two House-passed bills that close loopholes in the background check system. These are bills that received votes of both Republicans and Democrats in the House. This is not and should not be a partisan issue; this is an American issue. It will save lives—American lives—and we have to act. We should also ban assault weapons in the process.
May God bless you all and those families who are mourning today because of gun violence in Colorado and Georgia and all across the country. We have to act so there's not more of you—there's fewer of you—as time goes on.
You know, we're joined today by the Attorney General, Merrick Garland, who I've asked to prioritize gun violence. It's also good to see the Second Gentleman, who is here. And it's good to see the First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden, who cares deeply about this issue as well.
So I'm here to talk about two things: First, the steps we're going to take immediately, and, second, the action that needs to be taken going forward to curb the epidemic of gun violence.
But there are proven strategies that reduce gun violence in urban communities, and there are programs that have demonstrated they can reduce homicides by up to 60 percent in urban communities. But many of these have been badly underfunded or not funded at all of late.
Gun violence in America—for those of you who think of this from an economic standpoint listening to me—estimated to cost the Nation $280 billion—let me say it again—$280 billion a year. They said, "How could that be, Joe?" Hospital bills, physical therapy, trauma counseling, legal fees, prison costs, and the loss of productivity. Not to mention the psychological damage done to the children who live in these cities, watching this happen, knowing someone it happened to. This gun violence in our neighborhood is having a profound impact on our children, even if they're never involved in pulling the trigger or being the victim of—on the other side of a trigger.
For a fraction of the cost of gun violence, we can save lives, create safe and healthy communities, and build economies that work for all of us and save billions of American dollars in the meantime, much of it, as Senator Cicilline knows, is taxpayer money.
And I've said before: My job, the job of any President, is to protect the American people. Whether Congress acts or not, I'm going to use all the resources at my disposal as President to keep the American people safe from gun violence. But there's much more that Congress can do to help that effort. And they can do it right now.
They've offered plenty of thoughts and prayers—Members of Congress—but they've passed not a single new Federal law to reduce gun violence. Enough prayers. Time for some action.
These are some of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence and save lives. But all these bills, they had support of both Democrats and Republicans in the House. And universal background checks are supported by the vast majority of the American people and, I might add, the vast majority of responsible gun owners.
The idea that we have so many people dying every single day from gun violence in America is a blemish on our character as nation.
Let me say to all of you: God bless you, but most importantly, the memory of all many of you have lost to this senseless gun violence.
And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America. The flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. And, in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America—250 shot dead.
More than 2 weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know—the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence—I laid out several of the Department of Justice actions that are being taken to impact on this epidemic.
And I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it's time for Congress to act as well. Look, I don't want to become confrontational, but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democratic colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don't tell me it can't be done. We did it before, and it worked.
And that empathy—empathy—is the fuel of democracy, the willingness to see each other as opponents, not as enemies. Above all, to see each other as fellow Americans even when we disagree. From John's perspective, especially when we disagreed. That's how John forged consensus and made sure our system worked and delivered for the people. I saw it time and again on issues of war and peace. John opposing torture and ending gun violence; on protecting the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.
On May 7, we issued a proposed rule to help address the proliferation of ghost guns. On June 7, we issued a proposed rule to clarify that pistols equipped with certain stabilizing braces are subject to the same statutory restrictions as easily concealable, short-barreled rifles. And on the same day, the Department published model Extreme Risk Protection Order legislation for States to consider as they craft their own laws to reduce gun violence.
And we just met, as a I said, with a bipartisan group of mayors, law enforcement, and community leaders. And we discussed a comprehensive strategy that I'm releasing today to combat the epidemic of gun violence and other violent crime that we've been seeing in our country for far too long, that has spiked since the start of the pandemic over a year ago.
For folks at home, here's what you need to know: I've been at this a long time, and there are things we know that work that reduce gun violence and violent crime and things that we don't know about. But things we know about: Background checks for purchasing a firearm are important; a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines—no one needs to have a weapon that can fire over 30, 40, 50, even up to 100 rounds unless you think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests or something; community policing and programs that keep neighborhoods safe and keep folks out of trouble.
These efforts work. They save lives. But over time, these policies were gutted and are woefully underfunded. In our conversation today, we talked about our strategy to supercharge what works while we continue to push the Congress to act on sensible gun violence legislation.
Second, we discussed disrupting illegal gun trafficking. Now, the gun lobby wants you to believe that cities that are the toughest gun—have the toughest gun laws still have the highest rates of gun violence, as was pointed out by the group we had today in our roundtable. They—the violence is so—they argue, "Why do you need those gun laws if they don't work in cities that have tough laws?" Don't believe it.
And amid the COVID-19 pandemic, they've had to deal with a second public health crisis: gun violence. The American Rescue Plan, which we passed in the first hundred days of my administration, is providing much-needed, historic relief to bring back those law enforcement jobs and social service jobs.
Much of this relief has already arrived. The rest is on its way. And we're now providing more guidance on how they can use the $350 billion nationally that the American Rescue Plan has available to help reduce crime and address the root causes. For example, cities experiencing an increase in gun violence were able to use the American Rescue Plan dollars to hire police officers needed for community policing and to pay their overtime.
Mayors will also be able to buy crime-fighting technologies, like gunshot detection systems, to better see and stop gun violence in their communities. They can use the funding to scale up wraparound services for the residents as well, including substance abuse and mental health services that we know will make a difference to prevention of crime.
Attorney General Grewal of New Jersey and Mayor Daniel—and Mayor Daniella Levine Cava of Miami-Dade talked about their efforts to lift up those kinds of—their—the kinds of community programs that reduce gun violence, keep communities safe, and make real, positive difference in people's lives.
Eddie was formerly incarcerated for gun homicide, and DeVone lost his brother to gun violence. And Eddie worked as a violence interrupter. Now he runs a program that provides high-risk men with cognitive behavioral therapy to help them react to the impulses by slowing down rather than following through on the violence. It puts them in—he puts them in paid jobs to change their trajectory. The program has reduced shootings by 40 percent.
DeVone runs a program across California and six other States that enroll high-risk individuals in peace fellowships, complete with intensive mentoring and social services. It's saving lives. In Sacramento, for example, 91 percent of participants stayed away from gun violence.
As Vice President, I pushed hard to lift the freeze on gun violence research at the C—the Center for Disease Control, the CDC. Guess what? Why should they not be able to study gun violence and what causes it? But there's been a block on it. I want to unfreeze that.

And we need to keep building on the gun violence and crime-prevention strategy we're laying out today. Folks, this shouldn't be a red or blue issue, it's an American issue. We're not changing the Constitution; we're enforcing it, being reasonable. We're taking on the bad actors doing bad and dangerous things to our communities and to our country.
But the purpose of the meeting today is, we've convened a group of law enforcement and other community leaders, including mayors of the—of our cities: one, to thank them for their service because we owe them big time; second, to hear directly from each of them about reducing violent crime and, particularly, gun violence in their communities.
We recognize that we have to come together to fulfill the first responsibility of a democracy, and that's keep each other safe. And that's what the American people are looking for when it comes to reducing violent crime and gun violence.
Mr. Lemon. Mr. President, I want to talk about something else that affects people a lot, and to children as well. The next question—and it's about gun violence. This is from a paralegal, and she's an advocate. Her name is Andrea Solis Canto. She's a Democrat.

I think it was up to—what?—how many how dead? Five hundred over a period. Don't hold me to the number—whatever it was. But my point is, all across the country. And it's not because the gun shops in the cities are selling these guns. They are either shadow gun dealers and/or gun shops that are not abiding by the law.
The gunman targeted people and the diversity of El Paso and our most deeply held American values. And you know, we all act together to counter what is basically domestic terrorism, domestic violence, domestic extremism, and end the scourge of gun violence in America. We can't end it, but we sure can make a big difference than what it is now. And so I continue to do everything in my power to do that.
We need to work together to confront the epidemic of gun violence. Your brothers and sisters have told me over the years, sometimes, you feel like you're "outgunned." Right now the Justice Department, under the leadership of Attorney General Garland, is working with State and local law enforcement across the country to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals.

And I want to thank the folks in front of me for doing that. And I want to thank the Attorney General—Attorney General Garland—for leading these efforts as well.
And, folks, there's so much more to do: police reform, criminal justice reform, immigration, gun violence, the courts, protecting a woman's right to choose. All these critical issues.
We're also working to stem the flow of firearms and rogue gun dealers to curb epidemics of gun violence in this country. No greater victims than the Black communities. We talk about these massive shootings. Well, guess what? There's a massive shooting every day in urban America, the number of lives that are taken.
And—but the American Rescue Plan gives us the resources to do many of those things. And, you know, there's a lot of challenges out there that we're not even talking to directly; today, there's so many. But the surge of gun violence since the start of this pandemic.
And every day in this country, 316 people are shot, 106 are killed. And six NYPD officers have been victims of gun violence so far, just this year—the same in the town north of me, Philadelphia; and my much smaller town of Wilmington, Delaware; and Washington, DC.

I ask Democrats and Republicans alike to pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe. And we'll do everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking of ghost guns that you can buy online, assemble at home—no serial numbers, can't be traced. I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on the terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon. Why? Why?
We're going to improve the lives of millions of Americans. We'll meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate crisis, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more. It's literally within our power to do this. And we can make sure that this Nation is going to continue to be what it's always been.
We're going to continue to stand up to meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate change, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more.
If you commit a crime with a ghost gun, expect Federal prosecution, not just State. Expect Federal prosecution. This rule is an important step. It's going to make a difference, I promise you. And there are a lot of other things we know work to reduce gun violence and other violent crimes and save lives.
That's why I've put together a comprehensive strategy to supercharge what works while continuing to push Congress to act on sensible legislation to prevent gun violence.
And I've already made clear that I want cities, States, counties, and Tribes to use some of the $350 billion we sent to them in the American Rescue Plan—that I wrote in the first month—to reduce gun violence, hire police officers for community policing, pay police overtime, purchase crime-fighting technologies. They were given the money. They can do it. Spend it.
And last and certainly not least, I have partnered with the ATF for decades in its crucial fight against gun violence. You know, whether it was taking a single violent recidivist off the street in Maryland or putting together a big racketeering case against a violent gang in Youngstown, Ohio, I have seen the ATF work with other law enforcement to make so many of our communities safer.
The President. No, no, I'm serious. Think of what they—and they're saying. They're not kidding about it. And we haven't even talked about voting rights and gun violence and criminal justice, immigration. All things—and we just have—you know, the good news is we have 50 Senators and the Vice President. And the bad news is, there are 51 Presidents. [Laughter] Any one can declare themselves President, as two Democrats have.
The President. I spent a lot of time with this guy—Mayor Mike Duggan—and Police Chief James White. Are—they're using these ARP funds to modernize police training facilities, to invest in retention of police officers, gun violence prevention efforts, gunshot detection technology.
In Baton Rouge—Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Police Chief Murphy Pearl—Paul—excuse me—is using ARP funds to purchase 200 additional patrol cars while investing $3 million to implement proven strategy to reduce gun violence in communities, to produce prevention programs. In Tampa, Mayor Jane Castor and Mayor—and the police chief, Mary O'Connor, they're using ARP funds to modernize the city's fire prevention capacity, including with new fire vehicles. In Toledo, Ohio, Mayor Wade is using the ARP funds not only to avoid layoffs, but to add 100 police officers in the next few years.
And it's working. More than 300 communities, from big cities to small towns, are using more than $10 billion of American Rescue Plan funds for violence prevention and public safety this year: building new police training facilities; recruiting, which is getting harder; hiring; and giving policemen a raise; partnering with the Federal, State, and local community groups to reduce gun violence; investing in community interventions that use trusted community members to work directly with people who are most likely to commit gun crimes or become the victims of gun crimes and intervene before it's too late.
We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And if we can't ban assault weapons, then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21. Strengthen background checks. Enact safe storage law and "red flag" laws. Repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers from liability. Address the mental health crisis deepening the trauma of gun violence and as a consequence of that violence.
And let there be no mistake about the psychological trauma that gun violence leaves behind. Imagine being that little girl, that brave little girl in Uvalde—who smeared blood off her murdered friend's body onto her own face to lie still among the corpses in her classroom and pretend she was dead in order to stay alive. Imagine—imagine—what it would it be like for her to walk down the hallway of any school again.
This morning, though, I'm here—we're here to—on a critical issue: gun violence. You know, I'm about to sign into law a bipartisan safety—gun safety legislation. And time is of the essence. Lives will be saved.
You know, this is—also provides historic funding to address the youth mental health crisis in this country, especially—especially—the trauma experienced by the survivors of this gun violence.
Proof that we'll not grow numb to the epidemic of gun violence in this Nation. Proof that we can channel the pain and sorrow we see too often in America into a movement that will prevail.
This attack was—has had a profound impact on the psyche of the Japanese people. This is—this is a different—a different culture. They're not used to—as, unfortunately, we are. Here in the United States, we know how deep the wounds of gun violence go for communities that are affected. And this assassination is a tragedy that all the people of Japan are feeling.
And, Garnell, it's good to see you again. I know how tough it is. A lot of people in here have been victims of gun violence, lost sons, daughters, husbands, wives. They understand your pain. And every time you stand up to talk about it, even for a good cause, it brings it all back like it happened yesterday. But thank you for the courage to do it. Jill and I will never forget the time we spent with you and your families.
And as I look out in this crowd, I see so many advocates and families, many of whom have become friends, whose lives have been shattered by gun violence and who have made it their purpose to save other lives. I've spent so much time with so many of you over the years that we've actually become personal friends. And I can't thank you enough for your willingness to continue to fight for other families.
And this law also provides funding vital for funding to address the youth mental health crisis in this country, including the trauma experienced by the survivors of gun violence.
It will not save every life from the epidemic of gun violence, but if this law had been in place years ago, even this last year, lives would have been saved. It matters. It matters. But it's not enough, and we all know that.
In preparation for today's signing, I asked to send me their story—people to send me their stories about their experience with gun violence. I received over 2,500 responses in 24 hours. I didn't get to read them all, but I read some.
Your right to choose is on the ballot this year. The Social Security you paid for from the time you had a job is on the ballot. The safety of your kids from gun violence is on the ballot. And it's not hyperbole, the very survival of our planet is on the ballot. Your right to vote is on the ballot. Even the democracy.
My plan also takes commonsense action to reduce gun violence and violence overall. It builds on the progress we made this summer when I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun safety law we passed in 30 years. It took 30 years.
Law enforcement supported it. Faith leaders and teachers supported it. Victims of gun violence and their families supported it. Young people in this country, like the students of the great—this great university, support it.
Your safety of your kids from gun violence is on the ballot. The survival of our planet is literally on the ballot. Your right to vote—even our democracy—is on the ballot. Are you ready to fight for these things? Not to—I really mean it. We need to do everything we can to get folks organized, mobilized, and vote, vote, vote, vote!
The safety of kids and gun violence—from gun violence is on the ballot. Our kids should be going to school learning how to read and write, not how to duck and cover.
But my generic point is this, that you have, you know, a situation where we—you know, gun violence. The first major gun violence piece of legislation passed in a long time. We got it passed. We took on the NRA, and we beat them. And guess what? I'm going to ban assault weapons, I promise you. Not a joke. Not a joke. I did it once before. I did it once before.
Look, you know, if it wasn't for—who's counting? What, 47 days or thereabouts to the next election? And there's a lot up for grabs, a lot at stake, from choice to Social Security, to gun violence, to global warming, to the right to vote, to democracy itself.
Gun safety for our kids and gun violence are on the ballot. The idea that you start school this year and kids in many parts of the country learn how to duck and cover rather than—no, I'm serious; think about it—rather than talking about reading, writing, and arithmetic is a very different circumstance. It's not right. It's not who we are. It's not who we should be.
We also find that, you know, we finally passed—I'm very proud of fact we got the first major gun violence bill passed and beat the NRA, but it took 30 years. And guess what? They took out assault weapons. Assault weapons are still legal. People walk around the streets. Who the hell needs an assault weapon? And—they're adequately named. They're for killing people in wars. That's what they're about. The bullets travel—they're smaller—they travel five times as fast as a high-powered weapon, penetrates vests.
You know, and we're showing that we can do big things as a country when we work together, regardless of our political party, from taking on gun violence to supporting our veterans, to rebuilding America itself, to ending cancer as we know it.
You know, the whole idea of gun safety. You know, you pick up the paper every—I don't have to tell the Governor this; he's forgotten more about this than most people are ever going to know. But you know, you have these constant, constant examples of gun violence.
Look, so many of you on the call today are like family, and I want to thank you all for your support. We're less than 30 days away from the midterms, and the stakes are clear. The right to choose is on the ballot. Your Social Security you paid for your whole life is on the ballot. The safety of our kids and gun violence is on the ballot. Literally, the survival of the planet is —on the ballot. And your right to vote. And democracy itself on—is on the ballot.
You know, together, we're showing that we can do big things: Supporting our veterans. Ending cancer as we know it. Taking on gun violence. And by the way, we are going to ban assault weapons before I'm out of this place. I did it before. We're going to do it again.
And I especially want to thank the young people of this Nation, who—I'm told; I haven't seen the numbers—voted in historic numbers again and—just as they did 2 years ago. They voted to continue addressing the climate crisis, gun violence, their personal rights and freedoms, and the student debt relief.
We saw extraordinary results in these midterms elections that no one thought possible. More Independents voted for Democrats and Republicans in this election. Young people, you voted at historic numbers again, just as you did 2 years ago. Young people voted to continue addressing the climate crisis, gun violence, personal rights and freedoms, student debt relief, all those things which you stepped up to do.
Mentors—he mentors these—those historic kids from Parkland on their march and their lives—against gun violence. I met with every one of those kids, and they really appreciate what you did, George. Not a joke.
And, at this national vigil for victims of gun violence, I ask the country to join me in a moment of silence to remember every one of them.
It's fitting we continue the tradition to host the day after Dr. King's holiday. Look at what this team does: speaking out against racism, standing up for equality—I mean speaking out loudly against racism; standing up for equality; encouraging people to vote; empowering children and their families to eat healthy, learn, and play in safe places; rallying the country against gun violence.
And, Coach, I want to thank you again. I want to thank you again. I really mean it. I was told his dad was a great man and professor at Beirut University and so much more. But he was a victim of gun violence. But it matters.
Our prayers are with the people of Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay, and after yet another spree of gun violence in America.
He assembled the most diverse and most talented White House team in history and led them to solve some of the really difficult problems. With Ron's leadership, just look at what we've gotten here over the years—over the last 2 years alone: fighting COVID, reviving our economy, rebuilding the infrastructure, protecting our planet, fighting for gun—fighting against gun violence, advancing civil rights, winning confirmation of nearly 100 Federal judges, including the first Black Supreme Court Justice in history.
That was the plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde—I met with every one of them—"Do something about gun violence." Thank God—thank God—we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.
And it's a family's worst nightmare, and it's happening far too often in this country. Far too often. While we gather more information, there's one thing we do know to be true: We have to do something to stop the gun violence ripping apart our communities. Ripping apart.
The day after, we stood here in the East Room with Steph Curry, an NBA Champion who is a supporter of the—and the Golden—champion Golden State Warriors that continue the storied tradition of Black athletes playing a role bigger than just the game they play: speaking out against racism; standing up for equality; encouraging people to vote; empowering children and their families to eat healthy, learn and play in safe places; rallying the country against gun violence.
Last year, after the mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, I signed into law, after being in both places, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun safety law in almost 30 years. That was in addition to me signing more executive actions to reduce gun violence than any of my predecessors at this point in their Presidencies.
Last week, I laid out in my budget that we invest more in safer communities and expand access to mental health services for those affected by gun violence. Congressional Republicans should pass my budget instead of calling for cuts in these services or defunding the police or abolishing the FBI, as we hear from our MAGA Republican friends.
We're monitoring the situation really closely—Ben, as you know—and we have to do more to stop gun violence. It's ripping our communities apart, ripping the soul of this Nation—ripping at the very soul of the Nation. And we have to do more to protect our schools so they aren't turned into prisons.
You know, we have to do more to stop this gun violence—of ripping communities apart and ripping apart the soul of this Nation; to protect our children so they learn how to read and write instead of duck and cover in the classroom. You know, we need to act. These are weapons of war.
We passed the most significant bipartisan, as I said, gun safety law in 30 years because teachers now find themselves on the frontlines, and gun violence is a real problem. We want to do more. I continue to call on Congress for commonsense gun safety laws to protect kids and our teachers. Teaching should not be a life-threatening profession, and educators should not need to be armed to feel safe in a classroom.
It's just a long—there's just so much we have to do. Look, let's protect our children from gun violence, keep lowering the prescription drug cost. Let's protect Social Security and Medicare. We've gotten so much done, but there's so much more to do.
Folks, we passed the most significant legislation to reduce gun violence in 30 years, strengthening background checks, red flag laws, elimination of ghost guns. And we have a lot more to do. We have more to do. And we kept our promise to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court. And thanks to Dick Durbin, the head of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate, we've approved more Black women in the Federal circuit courts than all previous Presidents combined in American history. We've kept our promise.
Look, let's keep growing the economy in the middle—from the middle out and the bottom up. Let's protect—protect a woman's right to choose and codify Roe v. Wade. Let's protect our children from gun violence by continuing to work to eliminate assault weapons. And let's keep lowering the prescription drug cost not just for those on Medicare, but for all Americans—for all Americans. Folks, we've got to continue to protect Social Security and Medicare—something people have paid into their whole life, provide for such solace for so many Americans.
Folks, together, we're taking on another scourge in the nation: gun violence. After the tragedies in California, Kamala and I joined Judy Chu in Monterey Park to honor the victims and give the community—and grieve with them and to turn pain into purpose. And Jill and I invited Brandon Tsay as our guest to the State of the Union because we wanted the country to see—to see all of you—your courage, your resilience, your faith, your pride in America.
To stand with leaders of your generation who give voice to the people, demanding action on gun violence only to be expelled from State legislative bodies. To stand against books being banned and Black history being erased. I'm serious. Think about it. To stand up for the best in us.
But we also know there is more to do. Because of your power, we took the most significant law on gun violence—we passed it—the most significant law in 30 years. But we will not give up. I got the Assault Weapons Ban passed 30 years ago, and we're going to pass it again. We must pass it. And there's more to do on police reform and public safety.
We need to ban high-capacity magazines, the ability to shoot 20, 30, 40, 60 bullets without reloading. Because today, guns remain the number-one killer—the number-one killer—of children in America. Guns. And over the last year since Uvalde, our country has experienced a staggering 650 mass shootings and well over—it's hard to say—well over four—40,000 deaths due to gun violence.
The same goes for Senator Dick Blumenthal, a great friend. He was attorney general when my deceased son was attorney general of Delaware. Another leader in the fight against gun violence.
The facts give us reason to hope though. So far this year, murder is down in many major cities across the country. There's far too much gun violence, but that's why this summit is so important and why Chris asked me to be here today with the following message.
More people die from gun violence as a consequence of suicide than anything else that happens in the Nation. Suicide. This legislation has already delivered more than $1.5 billion to States and communities to make schools safer, improve access to mental health services, and help young people deal with the grief and trauma resulting from gun violence, posttraumatic stress syndrome.
All told, we've taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any of my predecessors—probably than all my predecessors. They're being challenged in court, but so far, so good. [Laughter]
Look, ladies and gentlemen, for those who say they're concerned about crime, you can't deal with crime without dealing with gun violence. It's a simple proposition.
Look, let me close with this. I know many people here who have been impacted by gun violence, lost someone they loved, fought so hard for so many years. A lot of you are tired.
One is the whole idea of dealing with gun violence. The idea that more children die as a consequence of a gunshot wound of a bullet than any other reason in America is sick. It's really sick.
And that's not all we've done. We passed the most significant legislation to reduce gun violence in 30 years, strengthening background checks, "red flag" laws. We banned ghost guns. We have a lot more—we have a lot more to do though.
Let's protect our children from gun violence and finally, once again, banning assault weapons and high-magazines. We did it once. And when we did, mass murders came down significantly—significantly. Who the hell needs a magazine that can hold 100 rounds? I mean, seriously, like what happened—anyway.
Finally, as you know all too well, educators now find themselves on the front lines of gun violence. All your—some of your members talked about it, Jill talked about. With your help, we passed the most significant bipartisan gun safety legislation in 30 years, but it's not nearly enough.
We need to address prevention and the root cause of the pain and trauma that a lot of people are feeling, like loneliness and isolation, social media and online bullying, gun violence.
You know, one of the Members who couldn't be here today is a really important Member: Senator Chris Murphy. With Chris, who, together with Congressman Frost, introduced the bill that created a dedicated gun violence prevention office—he couldn't be here today.
Well, my administration has been working relentlessly to do something. To date, my administration has announced dozens of executive actions to reduce gun violence, more than any of my predecessors at this point in their Presidencies. And they include everything from cracking down on ghost guns, breaking up gun trafficking, and so much more.
Look, while we push for Congress to do more, we're going to centralize, accelerate, and intensify our work to save more lives more quickly. That's why this new White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention—it's what it's designed to do. It will drive and coordinate a Government and a nationwide effort to reduce gun violence in America.
Second, coordinate more support for survivors, families, and communities affected by gun violence, including mental health care, financial assistance—the same way FEMA responds to natural disasters.
Third, identify new executive actions we can take within our legal authority to reduce gun violence.
Folks, to be clear, none of these steps alone is going to solve the entirety of the gun violence epidemic. None of them. But together, they will save lives. And it's going to help. It will help rally the Nation with a sense of urgency and seriousness of purpose.
In 2023 so far, our country has experienced more than 500 mass shootings and well over 30,000 deaths due to gun violence. This is totally unacceptable. It's not who we are. And we have to act, and we have to act now.
Look, folks, there comes a point where our voices are so loud, our determination so clear, that our effort can no longer be stopped. We're reaching that point. We've reached that point today, in my view, where the safety of our kids from gun violence is on the ballot.
So let me close with this. Earlier this summer, I was in Connecticut at a summit on gun safety hosted by Senator Murphy. Four students impacted by gun violence, who are here with us today, summoned extraordinary courage and stood and shared their stories on stage. Four of them.
And I do believe the right to be safe is also a civil right. Today, however, gun violence is the number-one cause of death for children in America. But instead of protecting our children, extremists obstruct.
But no—but all kidding aside, she's done a remarkable job in so many issues: protecting women's freedoms, combating gun violence, and I could go on all the issues that she's brought to—she's fought like hell for.
We're running because our children should have the right to go to school without fear of being gunned down by a weapon of war. More children in America die every year in America from gun violence than any other cause—any other cause: car accidents, anything. More children die in the United States of America.
That's why I wanted to convene this Cabinet meeting: to get an update on the progress we're making on pressing priorities for our country. And those include understanding the promise and peril of artificial intelligence, which we talked about last meeting. It includes taking action on gun violence, following up on our recent announcement of the new White House Office on Gun Violence Prevention that's going to be overseen by the Vice President. And today's meeting is going to provide an implementation update on both of those items.
You know, as we mourn today in Maine, this tragedy opens a painful—painful wounds all across the country. Too many Americans have lost loved ones or survived the trauma of gun violence.
And we join the people across the country praying for the families of those killed, whose hearts have been broken by yet another horrific gun violence.

Las Vegas—Las Vegas has already—they've already had real difficulty. So much gun violence. The 2017 shooting still in the minds of so many people. I was out here meeting with the families.

Folks, we've got to get smart. There have been over 600 mass shootings in America this year alone, plus daily acts of gun violence that don't even make the national news. This is not normal, and we can never let it become normal.

People have the right to feel safe, be safe, and I'm fighting to make sure they do. But all these actions I've taken as President of the United States to end this gun violence epidemic is not enough. We need Congress to step up.

But look, I'm not going to rest until we do all we can to prevent more families and more communities from being torn apart by gun violence.

We "have to get over it." My response is: We have to stop it so your children, your family, your friends can leave your home, walk the streets, go to stores, go to the grocery store, and go to church, to be safe from gun violence. There's no excuse for this carnage.
With your support, I also signed the first gun safety law in 30 years. And we're working with you to implement it, to coordinate these efforts and create the first-ever White House Office—I—we—what we did, my staff came along and said, you know, we need a White House Office dedicated to getting guns off the street and threatening—and treating the trauma from gun violence, because there's a lot of trauma as a consequence.
And the one State I don't have to talk about gun violence in is here. I've been hearing the tragic times that occurred here in this State.
And finally, my plan goes after the scourge of gun violence in America. I've taken more executive actions to stop the flow of illegal guns than any other administration in history. And we beat the NRA when I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years.
Tonight you've heard mine. I see a future where [we're; White House correction] defending democracy, you don't diminish it. I see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect our freedoms, not take them away. I see a future where the middle class has—finally has a fair shot and the wealthy have to pay their fair share in taxes. I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.
And I see a future where the planet moves from the climate crisis and our country away from the gun violence that we have so much of. I see a future where America remains the beacon of the world.
We see a future where we define democracy and defend it, not diminish it. We see a future where we defend the basic freedoms, not take them away. We see a future—we see a future where we reward work, not just wealth, where the wealthy pay their fair share. And we see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.
Anyway, we've got to do everything from gun violence to deal with choice. You know, our freedoms are at stake. They really are at stake—not a joke—the right to choose, the right to be able to determine whether you're going to get to vote, how we vote.
Look, I want to remind folks, because we turned out in 2020, we achieved the lowest unemployment rate for Latinos in a long, long time. We cut Hispanic child poverty to record lows. We lowered the health care costs. We made historic investments in Latino small businesses. And we addressed gun violence in the communities.
Imagine what we could do—from everything from the deficit to taking care of kids, education, so many—I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.
Look, I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence. Above all, a future for all Americans, for a country of all Americans, and I'll always be President for all Americans.
The world is watching America right now. They are watching. And they see, as we do, the urgency, then, of this moment. Across our Nation, we witness a full-on attack on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote, the freedom to live safe from the horror of gun violence, the freedom to be who you are and love who you love openly and with pride, and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do.
And, folks, I see a future where there's—you know, where we save the planet from a climate crisis and from gun violence. We have the capacity to do both those things. And above all, I see a future for all Americans, a future that can—that we can build together.
We've made historic investments in rebuilding the country, in computer chips, combating climate change, gun violence. But the first—I put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, as I promised I'd do. And I could go on.
And we've got to do something—the idea we send our kids to school teaching them to duck and cover. Think about that. The idea, in the United States of America—[inaudible]—duck and cover at school. More kids being killed by gun violence than almost anything else.
Where working people finally get a fair shot, where health care is a right, not a privilege—a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence. These aren't crazy ideas. These are basic ideas that the vast majority of American people agree with.
The safety of kids and gun violence—from gun violence is on the ballot. Our kids should be going to school learning how to read and write, not how to duck and cover.
Look, you know, if it wasn't for—who's counting? What, 47 days or thereabouts to the next election? And there's a lot up for grabs, a lot at stake, from choice to Social Security, to gun violence, to global warming, to the right to vote, to democracy itself.
He assembled the most diverse and most talented White House team in history and led them to solve some of the really difficult problems. With Ron's leadership, just look at what we've gotten here over the years—over the last 2 years alone: fighting COVID, reviving our economy, rebuilding the infrastructure, protecting our planet, fighting for gun—fighting against gun violence, advancing civil rights, winning confirmation of nearly 100 Federal judges, including the first Black Supreme Court Justice in history.
And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America. The flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. And, in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America—250 shot dead.
More than 2 weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know—the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence—I laid out several of the Department of Justice actions that are being taken to impact on this epidemic.
And I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it's time for Congress to act as well. Look, I don't want to become confrontational, but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democratic colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don't tell me it can't be done. We did it before, and it worked.
Mr. Lemon. Mr. President, I want to talk about something else that affects people a lot, and to children as well. The next question—and it's about gun violence. This is from a paralegal, and she's an advocate. Her name is Andrea Solis Canto. She's a Democrat.
So how will you address gun violence, from a Federal point of view, to actually bring about change and make our local cities safer?
The President. Now, I'm not being a wise guy. There's no reason you should—have you seen my gun violence legislation I've introduced? As you know—because you're so involved—actually, crime is down; gun violence and murder rates are up. Guns. I'm the only guy that ever got passed legislation, when I was a Senator, that made sure we eliminated assault weapons. The idea you need a weapon that can have the ability to fire 20, 30, 40, 50, 120 shots from that weapon—whether it's a 9-millimeter pistol or whether it's a rifle—is ridiculous.
Number two—number two—we're in a position where you—most of the cities—and I don't know enough—I think you've had a lot of gun violence here in Cincinnati. I think it was up to—what?—how many how dead? Five hundred over a period. Don't hold me to the number—whatever it was. But my point is, all across the country. And it's not because the gun shops in the cities are selling these guns. They are either shadow gun dealers and/or gun shops that are not abiding by the law.
The gunman targeted people and the diversity of El Paso and our most deeply held American values. And you know, we all act together to counter what is basically domestic terrorism, domestic violence, domestic extremism, and end the scourge of gun violence in America. We can't end it, but we sure can make a big difference than what it is now. And so I continue to do everything in my power to do that.
And, folks, there's so much more to do: police reform, criminal justice reform, immigration, gun violence, the courts, protecting a woman's right to choose. All these critical issues.
And—but the American Rescue Plan gives us the resources to do many of those things. And, you know, there's a lot of challenges out there that we're not even talking to directly; today, there's so many. But the surge of gun violence since the start of this pandemic.
The President. It's to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them. Fund them with the resources and training—resources and training they need to protect our communities. I ask Democrats and Republicans alike to pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe. And we'll do everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking of ghost guns that you can buy online, assemble at home—no serial numbers, can't be traced. I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on the terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon. Why? Why?
We're going to improve the lives of millions of Americans. We'll meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate crisis, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more. It's literally within our power to do this. And we can make sure that this Nation is going to continue to be what it's always been.
We're going to continue to stand up to meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate change, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more.
The President. No, no, I'm serious. Think of what they—and they're saying. They're not kidding about it. And we haven't even talked about voting rights and gun violence and criminal justice, immigration. All things—and we just have—you know, the good news is we have 50 Senators and the Vice President. And the bad news is, there are 51 Presidents. [Laughter] Any one can declare themselves President, as two Democrats have.
You know, together, we're showing that we can do big things: Supporting our veterans. Ending cancer as we know it. Taking on gun violence. And by the way, we are going to ban assault weapons before I'm out of this place. I did it before. We're going to do it again.
That was the plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde—I met with every one of them—"Do something about gun violence." Thank God—thank God—we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.
With your support, I also signed the first gun safety law in 30 years. And we're working with you to implement it, to coordinate these efforts and create the first-ever White House Office—I—we—what we did, my staff came along and said, you know, we need a White House Office dedicated to getting guns off the street and threatening—and treating the trauma from gun violence, because there's a lot of trauma as a consequence.
Tonight you've heard mine. I see a future where [we're; White House correction] defending democracy, you don't diminish it. I see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect our freedoms, not take them away. I see a future where the middle class has—finally has a fair shot and the wealthy have to pay their fair share in taxes. I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.
We see a future where we define democracy and defend it, not diminish it. We see a future where we defend the basic freedoms, not take them away. We see a future—we see a future where we reward work, not just wealth, where the wealthy pay their fair share. And we see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.
Imagine what we could do—from everything from the deficit to taking care of kids, education, so many—I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.
In this moment, we see extremists who try to divide our Nation. We see so-called leaders with the biggest pulpits and the biggest bully pulpits who encourage and incite xenophobia and hate, including anti-Asian hate. We see a full-on assault, State by State, on our most fundamental freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote, the freedom to live safe from the horror of gun violence, the freedom from hate and bigotry, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history, and the freedom of women to make decisions about their own body—and not have their government tell them what to do.
And, folks, the distinguished Senator from—deceased Senator from California and I passed the first ban on assault weapons. And guess what? It worked. If we care about public safety, we need to prevent gun violence.
And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America. The flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. And, in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America—250 shot dead.

We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don't tell me it can't be done. We did it before, and it worked.
And that empathy—empathy—is the fuel of democracy, the willingness to see each other as opponents, not as enemies. Above all, to see each other as fellow Americans even when we disagree. From John's perspective, especially when we disagreed. That's how John forged consensus and made sure our system worked and delivered for the people. I saw it time and again on issues of war and peace. John opposing torture and ending gun violence; on protecting the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.
Mr. Lemon. Mr. President, I want to talk about something else that affects people a lot, and to children as well. The next question—and it's about gun violence. This is from a paralegal, and she's an advocate. Her name is Andrea Solis Canto. She's a Democrat.
So how will you address gun violence, from a Federal point of view, to actually bring about change and make our local cities safer?

And it's not because the gun shops in the cities are selling these guns. They are either shadow gun dealers and/or gun shops that are not abiding by the law.
This attack was—has had a profound impact on the psyche of the Japanese people. This is—this is a different—a different culture. They're not used to—as, unfortunately, we are. Here in the United States, we know how deep the wounds of gun violence go for communities that are affected. And this assassination is a tragedy that all the people of Japan are feeling.
And I especially want to thank the young people of this Nation, who—I'm told; I haven't seen the numbers—voted in historic numbers again and—just as they did 2 years ago. They voted to continue addressing the climate crisis, gun violence, their personal rights and freedoms, and the student debt relief.
