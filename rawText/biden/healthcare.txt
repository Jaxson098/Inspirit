Any money I spend of yours—any money I spend—there's a provision of law back in the thirties saying "Buy American." So I made a commitment. I spend—I allocate somewhere around $700 billion of American taxpayers' money, whether it's to build a submarine or a highway or deal with healthcare. And guess what? No contract goes to anybody who isn't an American contractor and made in America. And people are really angry. But guess what? We—I came up with an idea of a thing called the CHIPS and—the CHIPS Act that we provided—and research.
And get this. In the State of Alabama, the attorney general is threatening to prosecute family members who help their loved ones travel to another State to get healthcare they need. That can't be America——
Joe comes in, boosts some of the subsidies, and that means millions more people are able to access healthcare that's affordable—and they can have some security.
We'd be able to right wipe out his debt. We'd be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do – childcare, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system, making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the – with – with – with the COVID. Excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with – look, if – we finally beat Medicare.
And so it's about giving healthcare. It's about making sure there's opportunity for people to have a good education. We should be—I've been pushing and we're going to get it done—early education. You know—you know all the studies better than I, as well as I do, that you come out of a neighborhood or a sc—a house where there's no books, where there's a, a dysfunctional family, where there's a problem—and you start off school, you hear million fewer words haven't been spoken because not, there's not conversation. Well, guess what? The studies show now, if you have three, four and five year olds going to early education, not, not daycare—education, you increase by 56% their ability to go through 12 years of school and on to Community College. And I'm gonna make Community College free. There's so many opportunities we have, and I think the community is beginning to see it. At least I hope so.

Additionally we will expand the pool of medical professionals, including retired healthcare workers, who can administer the vaccine and to ensure we have enough vaccinators to meet the nation's needs.

And so we're able to reduce and people will be able to pay for their health care and to get healthcare, including what we did with regard to insulin. You know anybody who needs insulin for type 2 diabetes? Or—anyway, if you know anybody who needs it, well, in some places you pay as average of $620 a month.
He later led the daunting and complicated task of fixing healthcare.gov—[laughter]—to get millions of Americans signed up for quality and affordable health care under the Affordable Care Act. And he led the National Economic Council, and he shares my determination to build an economy that works for everyone, works from the bottom up and the middle out. And—because when that happens, everybody does well.
During the pandemic, he's protected the safety of frontline healthcare workers, rooted out fraud from bad actors taking advantage of people, and stood up for homeowners trying to pay their mortgage during the devastating economic crisis.

And we're also making it easy to—easier to sign up for Obamacare. We've opened healthcare.gov for special enrollments on February the 15. In the first 2 weeks alone, more than 200,000 Americans gained coverage. Today I'm pleased to announce that we've extended that period to run through August the 15th. Just go to healthcare.gov or call the national hotline: 1-800-318-2596. That's 1-800-318-2596. A few clicks and a short conversation—that's all it takes to start seeing these benefits of increased coverage and lower premiums. I'll close with this: With the American Rescue Plan and the Affordable Care Act, millions of families will be able to sleep a little more soundly at night because they don't have to worry about losing everything if they get sick.
Fifth, if anyone is worried about getting health insurance during the pandemic, there's help today. For those who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, we're covering more people with more extensive benefits, with premiums that average 40-percent lower. If you don't have insurance, you can still sign up under the Affordable Care Act through August the 15th. Just go to healthcare.gov today.
Earlier this week, I announced that more than two-million-five-hundred-thousand Americans have signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act since I called for the special enrollment period during this pandemic. Folks, if you don't have insurance, you can still sign up under the Affordable Care Act through Sunday, August the 15th. Just go to healthcare.gov today, and get covered.
Second, for people who don't have health insurance, we're helping you get insurance. That way, people with diabetes can get protected with that $35 copay cap. People who are uninsured today can visit healthcare.gov to check out the options. In many cases, people can get a full health care plan, including coverage for insulin and other prescription drugs, doctor's visits, and hospitalizations for less than $10 a month if you sign up for the plan.
Gov. Beshear. We'll turn it over now to Colonel Jeremy Slinker. He is the head of emergency management in Kentucky. And I've got to say, he and his team have been doing an incredible job also getting things done that we've never seen before. We're now having, I think, every healthcare operator up and running, having to deliver water to so many of them.
And so we're able to reduce and people will be able to pay for their health care and to get healthcare, including what we did with regard to insulin. You know anybody who needs insulin for type 2 diabetes? Or—anyway, if you know anybody who needs it, well, in some places you pay as average of $620 a month.

I enacted tax credits that save, on average, $800 per person per year, reducing healthcare premiums for millions of working families on the Affordable Care Act. But those tax credits expire next year, and I'm calling on Congress to make and expand the Affordable Care Act tax credits and make them permanent—make them permanent.
I see an America where every—the economy grows from the middle out and the bottom up, because that's—when that works, everybody does well; the wealthy—the wealthy still do well, and everybody does well—we got a fighting chance—where working people finally have a fair shot; where healthcare becomes a right, not a privilege; where we make insulin affordable for everybody in America, capping prescription drug costs at 2,000 bucks a year for all—all—to all drugs.

This is the guy who talks about wanna get rid of the healthcare provision we put in place. This is the guy who wants to give the power back to Big Pharma to be able to charge exorbitant prices for drugs. This is the guy who wants to undo every single thing I've done, every single, ev, every single thing.
And so it's about giving healthcare. It's about making sure there's opportunity for people to have a good education. We should be—I've been pushing and we're going to get it done—early education.
