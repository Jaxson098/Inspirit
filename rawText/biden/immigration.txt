And let's also come together on immigration. Make it a bipartisan issue once again. We know—we now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers, seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.
But American border problems won't be fixed until Congress acts. If we don't pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border—and a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers.
On my very first day, I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress asking for a significant increase in the number of folks at the border—a significant increase in all the security we needed in terms of ti-tech [high-tech; White House correction] stuff.

It includes an additional 1,300 Border Patrols—we need more agents on the border; 375 immigration judges to judge whether or not someone can come or not come and be fair about it; 1,600 asylum officers; and over 100 cutting-edge inspect—inject—inspection machines to help detect and stop fentanyl coming in our Southwest Border.
But that's not all. Months ago, I instructed my team to begin negotiations with a bipartisan group of Senators—Democrats and Republicans—to finally fix our immigration system so it's fair and controllable. The result was a bipartisan agreement that represents the most fair, humane reforms to our immigration system in a long time.
The first bill I introduced as a Senator was to fix the immigration system. The very first thing—and I said, "Senator"—as President, I introduced. It would make the country safer, make our border more secure, but treat people fairly, ensure legal immigration consistent with our values as a nation and our international obligations. But Senate Republicans have blocked it now.
With a group of bipartisan Senators we put together over a 5-month period, the very conservative—a very conservative Senator from Oklahoma heading the group—of a meeting for 5—5 solid weeks toward the end, we agreed on the strongest border security law in American history: 1,500 more Border Security agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers and new policy so they can resolve 6—issues in 6 months instead of, now, 6 years; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly decrease the ability to smuggle in fentanyl and all its precursors.
Look, I proposed the most comprehensive immigration reform in decades while Trump is saying immigrants "poison the blood of the country," looking at many of you when he says it.
My first day in office, as I said, I sent a comprehensive immigration reform bill to Congress. It expands legal paths for entries for families and employers. It includes pathways to citizenship for Dreamers in the only country that they ever called home.
Folks, the reason why we're the fastest growing country in the world, why we're the best economy in the world is because of immigration. That's why we're—[inaudible]. That's not hyperbole, that's a fact.
But after months of bipartisan negotiations, I proposed the strongest border bill ever, a comprehensive immigration reform—in decades—a bipartisan bill that would require us to hire 1,500 more security agents and officers at the border; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backload of 2 million cases—there's a backload of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years and to get decisions faster.
We're a nation of immigrants. That's why this bipartisan bill also includes fair and humane immigrant reform—immigration reform in decades—the most significant. It includes a pathway for citizenship for "Dreamers" and so much more.
Folks, that's not who we are. That's not America. And we—and it really hurts us around the world, not in terms of immigration but in terms of what kind of people we are.
But in the months—after months of bipartisan negotiations, with one of the most conservative Members of the United States Senate from Oklahoma leading it for the Republicans—after months of it, we finally came up with the strongest border bill and the most comprehensive immigration reform in decades.
First bill I introduced when I got elected President was a bill relating to the border. This bipartisan bill that we all agreed on would require 1,500 more—1,500 more security agents on the border; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backload of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers; new policies to resolve—that can be resolved in 6 months instead of 6 years.
We're a—look, we're a nation of immigrants. That's why the bipartisan bill also includes the most fair and humane immigration reforms in decades. It includes a pathway for citizenship for "Dreamers" and so much more.
President Obama. Well—and, Joe, you also—for those Republicans who are trying to figure out what to do in this next election and are concerned, for example, about challenges at the border and immigration, it turns out that there was a bipartisan solution to help create a more orderly border and a more lawful system of immigration that the nominee of the other party decided to tank because he wanted it as an issue in this next election rather than to actually solve a problem.
We're going to protect our children and get the weapons of war off our streets. We're going to provide clean drinking water, affordable high-speed internet, quality education for every child in America. We're going to secure our border and protect legal immigration.
So that's when I took executive action. I said—and since I did the border, encounters have gone down over 50 percent. And we're going to keep it going down, fixing our legal immigration and creating pathways for citizenship for "Dreamers."
And unlike Trump, we will not demonize immigrants, saying they're the—"poison the blood of America"—[applause]—"poison the blood of our country." Kamala and I are committed to strengthening legal immigration, including protecting "Dreamers" and more.
Mr. Cooper. Let me ask about—a question which does often divide many people in this country: immigration.
Mr. Cooper. Your administration, along with congressional Democrats, expected to unveil an immigration reform bill just this week. You want a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants. Would you sign any immigration bill if it did not include that: a pathway for the roughly 11 million undocumented——
The President. Yes, there's a whole range of things that relate to immigration, including the whole idea how you deal with—you know, what confuses people, is you talk about refugees, you talk about undocumented, you talk about people who are seeking asylum, and you talk about people who are coming from the—that are coming from camps or being held around the world.
And the other problems we're talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they've been around a long time. And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and—whether it's immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.
The President. No, no, but I mean—I don't know how much detail you want about immigration. Maybe I'll stop there, and finish——
And in addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what Zeke was asking about, there's—immigration is a big issue, of course, when it—related to the filibuster, but there's also Republicans who are passing bill after bill, trying to restrict voting rights. Chuck Schumer is calling it an "existential threat" to democracy. Why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues including voting rights or immigration?
The President. First of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all—did not slow up the amount of immigration—and there's many people coming.
And here's what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to America. Let's end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we've done nothing about it. It's time to fix it.
On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 11 million undocumented folks—the vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it. We can actually—if you actually want to solve a problem, I've sent a bill to—so take a close look at it.
Look, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let's argue over it, let's debate it, but let's act.
And finally, there's much more to be done and so much more to do—tackling voting rights, which is an existential threat to democracy right now. The things that are being asked are just beyond the pale. And the Vice President has been working hard on this issue and is going to continue to—we all are—but there's much more to do. We have to tackle the immigration problem, which we're working really hard to get done in a humane and serious way. Police reform and crime.
Mr. Lemon. I want to talk to you about DACA. I've got two questions on immigration. They're quick questions I want to ask you about. Because just last week, there was a Federal judge who ruled the program unlawful, blocked it from accepting new applications. What do you say to DREAMers who are really worried about their futures here in the United States?
People do it because they're desperate. They're desperate. And what I've been trying to do and I'm trying to do in this legislation as well is get funding so we have funding for immigration officers to be able to hear cases immediately of whether or not they justify having asylum granted to them.

And I think that's where we are again. And I think we have a chance to sort of restate and reassert our world leadership on a whole range of issues and lead the world on everything from the environment to dealing with the issues of immigration, a whole range of issues, Gov.
Folks, if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure our border and fix the immigration system.
The President. And as you might guess, I think we can do both. At our border, we've installed new technology, like cutting-edge scanners, to better detect drug smuggling. We've set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers. We're putting in place dedicated immigration judges in significant larger number so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases—cases heard faster—and those who don't [aren't]* legitimately here can be sent back.
It's not only the right thing to do, it's economically smart thing to do. That's why the immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Let's get it done once and for all.
Look, we're working to fix our immigration system to reflect our values and the truth that legal immigration defines who we are as a nation—who we are as a nation. That's why we're so darn strong.
Now, look, as was mentioned by all of us in one way or another, this has been the greatest migration in human history around the world, as well as in this hemisphere. And when I got elected, the first thing I—the first major piece of legislation I introduced was to reform the immigration process, to make it more orderly, to make it more—to make sure people have access under the law.
We have—we can do more than merely just make legal immigration more streamlined. But we can also do it by preventing people from wanting to have to leave in the first place, by helping their communities, in fact, better their circumstances.
But there's more to do. As was mentioned by the—by your president, immigration is another major issue affecting many of your communities, particularly border communities and near—and near communities.
The first bill I introduced was a comprehensive reform legislation on immigration. But because of some in the Congress, they refused to consider it. They found it a better issue to campaign on than an issue to solve.
So we have a choice: They can keep using immigration to try to score political points, or we can help solve the problem. Immigration reform used to be a bipartisan issue. And we can make it that again, in my view.
And let's also come together on immigration. Make it a bipartisan issue once again. We know—we now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers, seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.
But American border problems won't be fixed until Congress acts. If we don't pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border—and a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers.
Over and over, I've asked for resources to step up action at the border. In October, I asked Congress to fund—for funding that would add another 20 additional border—twenty—2,000 additional border agents and officers, hundreds of new immigration judges to make the judgments on the spot, a new—new detection equipment to stop fentanyl from coming into the country.
Folks, we've spent months working on a bipartisan border bill that included the most humane, fair reforms to our immigration system ever. It also included the toughest set of reforms to secure the border ever.
There's one other piece of unfinished business I want to talk about: the border. My first day in office as President, the first bill I sent, I sent up a comprehensive plan to fix the immigration system.

Folks, Congress has had a long, proud history of—bipartisan history on immigration reform and abiding by our international treaty obligations, which we've signed, relating to immigration. These reforms made America a nation of laws, a nation of immigrants, and the strongest economy in the world.

But something changed. Over time, our laws and our resources haven't kept up with our immigration system, and it's broken. And our politics has failed to fix it.

That's why, months ago, I instructed my team to begin a series of negotiations in a bipartisan group of Senators, Democrats and—led by a very conservative Republican, who did a hell of a job, to fix our immigration system. I provided each of you, as I said, a fact sheet with the details of that bipartisan deal.

The Border Patrol chief himself said, "We need more people. We need more agents on the line." Our bipartisan bill got the Border Patrol the agents they need. It funds and hires 1,500 more agents and officers—1,500; 100 more immigration judges; 4,300 more asylum officers to get asylum decisions in months instead of years.

Look, it's the strongest border deal our country has ever seen. It also includes the most fair and humane reforms for legal immigration in a long time. Let's get it done.

That bipartisan bill would hire 1,500 more security agents and officers, 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backload of 2 million cases, 4,300 more asylum officers, and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years now. What are you against?
Unlike my predecessor, on my first day in office, I introduced a comprehensive bill to fix our immigration system. Take a look at it. It has all these and more: secure the border, provide a pathway to citizenship for "Dreamers," and so much more.
That bipartisan deal would hire 1,500 more border security agents and officers; 1,000—100 more immigration judges to help tackle a backlog of 2 million cases that are just waiting to be heard; 4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly increase our ability to stop fentanyl from being smuggled into America. And by the way, no one questions those numbers.
And by the way, I proposed the most comprehensive immigration reform bill in decades. It includes a pathway to citizenship for "Dreamers" and expands the number of green cards so more families can build their American Dream together.
While we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, he calls immigrants "rapists" and "murderers." He says they are "not people"—they are "not people." He says immigrants are, quote, "poisoning the blood of our country." Folks, my predecessor wants a country just for some of us. We want a country for all of us.
And by the way, the first bill I introduced was the most comprehensive immigration reform bill in decades. It includes a pathway to citizenship for "Dreamers" and expands the number of green cards so many more families can build their American Dream together.
And while we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, Trump continues to vilify immigrants. I can't believe the way this guy talks. He talks about immigrants as "rapists" and "murderers"—his words, not mine. He said they are "not people"—they are "not people." He says immigrants are "poisoning the blood of this country."
We're going to protect our children and get the weapons of war off our streets. We're going to provide clean drinking water, affordable high-speed internet, quality education for every child in America. We're going to secure our border and protect legal immigration.

We're going to continue to stand up to meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate change, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more.
And on the other hand, and as is set down in the joint declaration, we have agreed to strengthen the bonds between us in the areas of justice, cybersecurity, energy security—and by the way, I'm very grateful to the U.S. Government and the whole of the U.S. for all that LPG that we are receiving in Spain—and also the management of immigration flows, everything that has to do with climate change, technology, and digital transformation.
And let's also come together on immigration. Make it a bipartisan issue once again. We know—we now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers, seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.

With child care and elder care that make it possible for parents to go to work and for the elderly to stay in their homes with dignity. With an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values. With newly empowered labor unions. With equal pay for women. With rising wages you can raise a family on. Yes, we're going to do more than praise our essential workers. We're finally going to pay them.

For example, I know that this week you're working on the "Protect Our Democracy" reforms, as well as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act—both of which I strongly support. And I know that, in the past couple of days, you've had briefings and conversations on immigration, health care, foreign policy, climate crisis, and a lot more. And as you work on all of these, I urge you to continue to speak up and speak out about the American Rescue Plan.
And the other problems we're talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they've been around a long time. And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and—whether it's immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.

That's why I wrote these bills in the first place. That's why it will matter so much when I sign them into law, because of you. And there's so much more to do: protecting the sacred right to vote, immigration, the courts, building on the Affordable Care Act, protecting a woman's right to choose, and so much more.
And I think that's where we are again. And I think we have a chance to sort of restate and reassert our world leadership on a whole range of issues and lead the world on everything from the environment to dealing with the issues of immigration, a whole range of issues, Gov.

The President. No, no, I'm serious. Think of what they—and they're saying. They're not kidding about it. And we haven't even talked about voting rights and gun violence and criminal justice, immigration. All things—and we just have—you know, the good news is we have 50 Senators and the Vice President. And the bad news is, there are 51 Presidents. [Laughter] Any one can declare themselves President, as two Democrats have.
And we're working to fix our immigration system as well. As I said—[applause]—it's important. As I said in my State of the Union Address, we can secure our borders and keep lit the torch of liberty. On my first day in office, I sent an immigration bill to Congress that would provide a pathway to citizenship for immigrants contributing to our economy. That's—we are—we—you know, we are an immigrant nation. I mean, we literally—I mean, we say that, but people act like they don't believe it. We are an immigrant—and that is our strength. That is our strength.
And the other problems we're talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they've been around a long time. And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and—whether it's immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.

Because just last week, there was a Federal judge who ruled the program unlawful, blocked it from accepting new applications. What do you say to DREAMers who are really worried about their futures here in the United States?
The President. Okay. Well, everybody, welcome. Today I have the privilege of meeting with Latino leaders to discuss a bunch of key issues that affect the community; the progress we're making against the pandemic; historic and economic recovery we're under—that's undergoing—we're undergoing; and immigration and voting rights, which are critical.
And, folks, there's so much more to do: police reform, criminal justice reform, immigration, gun violence, the courts, protecting a woman's right to choose. All these critical issues.
And I think that's where we are again. And I think we have a chance to sort of restate and reassert our world leadership on a whole range of issues and lead the world on everything from the environment to dealing with the issues of immigration, a whole range of issues, Gov.

We're going to improve the lives of millions of Americans. We'll meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate crisis, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more. It's literally within our power to do this. And we can make sure that this Nation is going to continue to be what it's always been.
We're going to continue to stand up to meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate change, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more.
The President. No, no, I'm serious. Think of what they—and they're saying. They're not kidding about it.

And the bad news is, there are 51 Presidents. [Laughter] Any one can declare themselves President, as two Democrats have.
You know, that's all of you. That's the incredible South Asian community all across America: Helping us emerge stronger from this pandemic. Building an economy that works for everyone. Teaching our children and caring for our elders. Responding to the cry for action on climate. Working to fix our immigration system. Defending rights and freedoms. Building a more just and equitable country. Serving and protecting our communities and our Nation. Informing, entertaining, inspiring.
And let's also come together on immigration. Make it a bipartisan issue once again. We know—we now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers, seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.
But American border problems won't be fixed until Congress acts. If we don't pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border—and a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers.
Over and over, I've asked for resources to step up action at the border. In October, I asked Congress to fund—for funding that would add another 20 additional border—twenty—2,000 additional border agents and officers, hundreds of new immigration judges to make the judgments on the spot, a new—new detection equipment to stop fentanyl from coming into the country.
That bipartisan bill would hire 1,500 more security agents and officers, 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backload of 2 million cases, 4,300 more asylum officers, and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years now. What are you against?
Unlike my predecessor, on my first day in office, I introduced a comprehensive bill to fix our immigration system. Take a look at it. It has all these and more: secure the border, provide a pathway to citizenship for "Dreamers," and so much more.
No one should ever doubt where my heart is. Unlike Donald Trump, on my first day in office as President, I introduced a comprehensive plan to fix our immigration system, secure our border, provide a pathway for citizenship for "Dreamers" and their families, farmworkers, essential workers who helped us through the pandemic and are part of the fabric of our community.
With a group of bipartisan Senators, led by a very conservative Senator from Oklahoma, we agreed over a 5-week period to the strongest border law in American history: One thousand—[applause]—1,500 more border agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to hear the cases and the backlog—there's a backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years, which every study shows will discourage people from going to these cowboys and being—paying 8,000 bucks to be smuggled across, knowing—if you know you're not going to be looked at again for another 6 years, then you—come, but if you know you're going to be out in 6 weeks, it's a different thing; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines—what I've been calling for for a long time—to significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles from smuggling fentanyl into America.
With a group of bipartisan Senators we put together over a 5-month period, the very conservative—a very conservative Senator from Oklahoma heading the group—of a meeting for 5—5 solid weeks toward the end, we agreed on the strongest border security law in American history: 1,500 more Border Security agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers and new policy so they can resolve 6—issues in 6 months instead of, now, 6 years; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly decrease the ability to smuggle in fentanyl and all its precursors.
You know, with a group of bipartisan Senators, led by a very conservative Senator from Oklahoma, we negotiated for weeks and agreed on the strongest national security, border security law in American history: 1,500 more border security agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve all these cases in 6 months instead of 6 years, because it takes 6 to 8 years now to resolve these cases—it's chaos; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines that significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles from smuggling fentanyl into America.
Look, I proposed the most comprehensive immigration reform in decades, while Trump says immigrants are the—"poisoning the blood of America." Well, I wonder how many of us would be here if that was the case when our forefathers came—when our folks came. He says the biggest threat—the biggest threat is these—these criminals coming across the border.
President Obama. Well—and, Joe, you also—for those Republicans who are trying to figure out what to do in this next election and are concerned, for example, about challenges at the border and immigration, it turns out that there was a bipartisan solution to help create a more orderly border and a more lawful system of immigration that the nominee of the other party decided to tank because he wanted it as an issue in this next election rather than to actually solve a problem.
With child care and elder care that make it possible for parents to go to work and for the elderly to stay in their homes with dignity. With an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values. With newly empowered labor unions. With equal pay for women. With rising wages you can raise a family on. Yes, we're going to do more than praise our essential workers. We're finally going to pay them.
And it's a job that plays a critical role in fixing our broken immigration system.

And while DHS affects everyone, given its critical role in immigration matters, I am proud that for the first time ever, the Department will be led by an immigrant, a Latino, who knows that we are a nation of laws and values.

But the purpose of my asking you here today is, I want to congratulate the new Secretary. Secretary Mayorkas is going to take on an easy job—nothing to it: Homeland Security. And going to deal—I'm looking forward to his leadership and working with Congress on a lot of issues, including the immigration bill that has, I think, great support in both Chambers.
Today I'm going to sign a few Executive orders to strengthen our immigration system, building on the Executive actions I took on day one to protect DREAMers and to end the Muslim ban and to better manage of our borders. And that's what these three different Executive orders are about.
And I want to make it clear—there's a lot of talk, with good reason, about the number of Executive orders that I have signed—I'm not making new law; I'm eliminating bad policy. What I'm doing is taking on the issues that—99 percent of them—that the President—the last President of the United States issued Executive orders I felt were very counterproductive to our security, counterproductive to who we are as a country, particularly in the area of immigration.
This is about how America is safer, stronger, more prosperous when we have a fair, orderly, and humane legal immigration system. And with the first action today, we're going to work to undo the moral and national shame of the previous administration that literally, not figuratively, ripped children from the arms of their families—their mothers and fathers at the border—and with no plan, none whatsoever, to reunify the children who are still in custody and their parents.
And the third action—the third order I'm going to be signing—orders a full review of the previous administration's harmful and counterproductive immigration policies, basically across the board. And so, with that, I'm going to sign the first order, which is the reestablishment of an Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families.
Mr. Cooper. Let me ask about—a question which does often divide many people in this country: immigration.
Mr. Cooper. Your administration, along with congressional Democrats, expected to unveil an immigration reform bill just this week. You want a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants. Would you sign any immigration bill if it did not include that: a pathway for the roughly 11 million undocumented——
The President. Yes, there's a whole range of things that relate to immigration, including the whole idea how you deal with—you know, what confuses people, is you talk about refugees, you talk about undocumented, you talk about people who are seeking asylum, and you talk about people who are coming from the—that are coming from camps or being held around the world.
For example, I know that this week you're working on the "Protect Our Democracy" reforms, as well as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act—both of which I strongly support. And I know that, in the past couple of days, you've had briefings and conversations on immigration, health care, foreign policy, climate crisis, and a lot more. And as you work on all of these, I urge you to continue to speak up and speak out about the American Rescue Plan.
And the other problems we're talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they've been around a long time. And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and—whether it's immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.
The President. No, no, but I mean—I don't know how much detail you want about immigration. Maybe I'll stop there, and finish——
And in addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what Zeke was asking about, there's—immigration is a big issue, of course, when it—related to the filibuster, but there's also Republicans who are passing bill after bill, trying to restrict voting rights. Chuck Schumer is calling it an "existential threat" to democracy. Why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues including voting rights or immigration?
The President. First of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all—did not slow up the amount of immigration—and there's many people coming.
We're going to talk about everything today, my guess is, from immigration to the—my Jobs Plan and what—how it worked for you and how it didn't, what you think we should be doing.
And here's what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to America. Let's end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we've done nothing about it. It's time to fix it.
On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 11 million undocumented folks—the vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it. We can actually—if you actually want to solve a problem, I've sent a bill to—so take a close look at it.
Look, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let's argue over it, let's debate it, but let's act.
We should, and that's why I introduced a comprehensive immigration bill. There's 11 million undocumented people in the United States, the vast majority of whom overstayed their visas.
All of you represent how immigration has always been essential to America. We're constantly renewing ourselves. Constantly. When we come out of this pandemic and build an economy, we're going to build it back better. If we're going to do that, we need to fix our immigration system and fully tap the talent and dynamism in our Nation.
Folks, in the competition for the 21st century, we need an immigration system that both reflects our values and upholds our laws. We can do both.
And finally, there's much more to be done and so much more to do—tackling voting rights, which is an existential threat to democracy right now. The things that are being asked are just beyond the pale. And the Vice President has been working hard on this issue and is going to continue to—we all are—but there's much more to do. We have to tackle the immigration problem, which we're working really hard to get done in a humane and serious way. Police reform and crime.
Mr. Lemon. I want to talk to you about DACA. I've got two questions on immigration. They're quick questions I want to ask you about. Because just last week, there was a Federal judge who ruled the program unlawful, blocked it from accepting new applications. What do you say to DREAMers who are really worried about their futures here in the United States?
The President. It went very well. What I think we—I think we should include in the reconciliation bill the immigration proposal. My staff is putting out a message right now.
The President. Okay. Well, everybody, welcome. Today I have the privilege of meeting with Latino leaders to discuss a bunch of key issues that affect the community; the progress we're making against the pandemic; historic and economic recovery we're under—that's undergoing—we're undergoing; and immigration and voting rights, which are critical.
We have a full agenda to discuss: the pandemic, the economy, immigration, voting rights, and hate crimes.
There is work to do on immigration; there's work to do on voting rights and so much more.
Operation Allies Refugee [Refuge],* which I announced back in July, has already moved 2,000 Afghans who are eligible for special immigration visas and their families to the United States. In the coming days, the U.S. military will provide assistance to move more SIV-eligible Afghans and their families out of Afghanistan.
People do it because they're desperate. They're desperate. And what I've been trying to do and I'm trying to do in this legislation as well is get funding so we have funding for immigration officers to be able to hear cases immediately of whether or not they justify having asylum granted to them.
People do it because they're desperate. They're desperate. And what I've been trying to do—and I'm trying to do in this legislation, as well—is get funding so we have funding for immigration officers to be able to hear cases immediately of whether or not they justify having asylum granted to them.
That's why I wrote these bills in the first place. That's why it will matter so much when I sign them into law, because of you. And there's so much more to do: protecting the sacred right to vote, immigration, the courts, building on the Affordable Care Act, protecting a woman's right to choose, and so much more.
And there's so much more to do: voting rights, immigration, the courts, building on the Affordable Care Act, protecting women's right to choose, and so much more.
And, folks, there's so much more to do: police reform, criminal justice reform, immigration, gun violence, the courts, protecting a woman's right to choose. All these critical issues.
And I think that's where we are again. And I think we have a chance to sort of restate and reassert our world leadership on a whole range of issues and lead the world on everything from the environment to dealing with the issues of immigration, a whole range of issues, Gov.
Folks, if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure our border and fix the immigration system.
The President. And as you might guess, I think we can do both. At our border, we've installed new technology, like cutting-edge scanners, to better detect drug smuggling. We've set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers. We're putting in place dedicated immigration judges in significant larger number so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases—cases heard faster—and those who don't [aren't]* legitimately here can be sent back.
It's not only the right thing to do, it's economically smart thing to do. That's why the immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Let's get it done once and for all.
We're going to improve the lives of millions of Americans. We'll meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate crisis, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more. It's literally within our power to do this. And we can make sure that this Nation is going to continue to be what it's always been.
We're going to continue to stand up to meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate change, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more.
Your country was transformed in the 50 years after the Civil War, at a time when immigration, including from Ireland, was at its peak. For them and countless others like them, America became what Seamus Heaney calls "the further shore" where "the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up, and hope and history rhyme."
The President. No, no, I'm serious. Think of what they—and they're saying. They're not kidding about it. And we haven't even talked about voting rights and gun violence and criminal justice, immigration. All things—and we just have—you know, the good news is we have 50 Senators and the Vice President. And the bad news is, there are 51 Presidents. [Laughter] Any one can declare themselves President, as two Democrats have.
And we're working to fix our immigration system as well. As I said—[applause]—it's important. As I said in my State of the Union Address, we can secure our borders and keep lit the torch of liberty. On my first day in office, I sent an immigration bill to Congress that would provide a pathway to citizenship for immigrants contributing to our economy. That's—we are—we—you know, we are an immigrant nation. I mean, we literally—I mean, we say that, but people act like they don't believe it. We are an immigrant—and that is our strength. That is our strength.
Look, we're working to fix our immigration system to reflect our values and the truth that legal immigration defines who we are as a nation—who we are as a nation. That's why we're so darn strong.
This is just a start. There's—much more work remains, to state the obvious. Every country needs to work together to maintain a humane and orderly immigration process, to invest in securing the borders, screening and registering migrants who enter their countries, and repatriating those that do not qualify to remain.
And on the other hand, and as is set down in the joint declaration, we have agreed to strengthen the bonds between us in the areas of justice, cybersecurity, energy security—and by the way, I'm very grateful to the U.S. Government and the whole of the U.S. for all that LPG that we are receiving in Spain—and also the management of immigration flows, everything that has to do with climate change, technology, and digital transformation.
Unfortunately, such hate-fueled violence and threats are not new to America. There is a through-line of hate from massacres of Indigenous people to the original sin of slavery, the terror of the Klan, to anti-immigration violence against the Irish, Italians, Chinese, Mexicans, and so many others laced throughout our history. There is a through-line of violence against religious groups: anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic, anti-Mormon, anti-Muslim, anti-Hindu, anti-Sikh.
And I'm proud that the Obama-Biden administration stood up for "Dreamers." My predecessor tried to end DACA, but the Biden-Harris administration is working to preserve it and fortify it. And with Secretary Mayorkas's leadership, we're committed to fixing the immigration system.
Look, along with Secretary Mayorkas, I'm also committed to fixing the immigration system for good, providing a pathway for "Dreamers." Can you imagine—maybe some of you were "Dreamers." It's like you—well, I don't know what people expect to say when your mom has taken you across the Rio Grande and say: "No, Mom, I'm staying here. I'm not going. I'm going to make my choice." Come on. This is bizarre. The temporary status holders, farm workers, and essential workers as well. We have to do more to modernize our laws so businesses can get workers they need and families don't have to wait decades—decades—to be together.
We've had large waves of immigration before. But the thing is, you just have enormous opportunities to make this country so much better. And I really mean it. I really mean it.
You know, that's all of you. That's the incredible South Asian community all across America: Helping us emerge stronger from this pandemic. Building an economy that works for everyone. Teaching our children and caring for our elders. Responding to the cry for action on climate. Working to fix our immigration system. Defending rights and freedoms. Building a more just and equitable country. Serving and protecting our communities and our Nation. Informing, entertaining, inspiring.
Today I'd like to—the Vice President and I would like to talk you about how my administration is dealing with our situation in the southwest border. Now, these actions alone that I'm going to announce today aren't going to fix our entire immigration system, but they can help us a good deal in better managing what is a difficult challenge.
On my first day in office, some of you may recall, who cover this area—and they cover it well—I sent Congress a comprehensive piece of legislation that would completely overhaul what has been a broken immigration system for a long time: cracking down on illegal immigration; strengthening legal immigration; and protecting "Dreamers," those with temporary protected status, and farmworkers, who all are part of the fabric of our Nation.
But congressional Republicans have refused to consider my comprehensive plan. And they rejected my recent request for an additional $3.5 billion to secure the border and funds for 2,000 new asylum personnel, another—asylum officers and personnel—and a hundred new immigration judges so people don't have to wait years to get their claims adjudicated, which they have a right to make a claim legally.
But instead of safe and orderly process at the border, we have a patchwork system that simply doesn't work as it should. We don't have enough asylum officers or personnel to determine whether people qualify for asylum. There's a standard by what you have to meet. You don't—we don't have enough immigrant judges—immigration judges to adjudicate the claims of immigrants.
And until Congress passes the funds—a comprehensive immigration plan to fix the system completely—my administration is going to work to make things better at the border using the tools that we have available to us now.
That work will not be done unless and until the Congress enacts and funds a more comprehensive immigration plan that I proposed on day one. Until Congress has acted, I can act where I have legal capacity to do so.
Last year, I brought together 20 leaders—many of you were there—from the Western Hemisphere—heads of state—to stabilize the flow of immigration, to expand pathways to immigration, and to manage border—and to manage the border humanely.
It's clear that immigration is a political issue that extreme Republicans are always going to run on. But now they have a choice: They can keep using immigration to try to score political points, or they can help solve the problem. They can help solve the problem and come together to fix the broken system.
Before Congress adjourned for the holidays, some Democrats and Republicans, a few of them, got together—both sides, up in the Senate—and decided they were going to put together a comprehensive plan on immigration.
But the Republican leadership and other Republicans—I don't know who—exactly who did it—rebuked it and rejected it out of hand—it broke up—just like they rejected my plan 2 years ago, just like they rejected my recent request for an additional $3.5 billion to secure and manage the border with more holding facilities, better transportation, additional funding for 2,000 new asylum officers and personnel, 100 new immigration judges to more rapidly adjudicate for people when they come here, and how much—and so much more.
Think about it. I mean, if this were something if we were—if we had to have a hundred more immigration officers to see to it that we're able to import something we needed very badly, it wouldn't take very much time to get it, would it? It'd be real—done. Or, conversely, if there were criminal gangs coming into the Nation or the—I mean—but when it comes to immigration, it seems like it's a better issue—a better issue for them than trying to solve it.
As I've always done when I sit down—I'll sit down with anyone who, in good faith, wants to fix our broken immigration system. And it's hard. It's hard on the best of circumstances. But if the most extreme Republicans continue to demagogue this issue and reject solutions, I'm left with only one choice: to act on my own, do as much as I can on my own to try to change the atmosphere.
That's why immigration reform is supported by everyone. Think of this now. I want to remind the public: Immigration reform is supported by the American labor movement—unions. It's supported by religious leaders. It's supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
We can secure our border, fix the immigration system to be orderly, fair, safe, and humane. We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrations to America—many of our forebearers, many of yours.
Now, look, as was mentioned by all of us in one way or another, this has been the greatest migration in human history around the world, as well as in this hemisphere. And when I got elected, the first thing I—the first major piece of legislation I introduced was to reform the immigration process, to make it more orderly, to make it more—to make sure people have access under the law.
We have—we can do more than merely just make legal immigration more streamlined. But we can also do it by preventing people from wanting to have to leave in the first place, by helping their communities, in fact, better their circumstances.
But there's more to do. As was mentioned by the—by your president, immigration is another major issue affecting many of your communities, particularly border communities and near—and near communities.
The first bill I introduced was a comprehensive reform legislation on immigration. But because of some in the Congress, they refused to consider it. They found it a better issue to campaign on than an issue to solve.
So we have a choice: They can keep using immigration to try to score political points, or we can help solve the problem. Immigration reform used to be a bipartisan issue. And we can make it that again, in my view.
And let's also come together on immigration. Make it a bipartisan issue once again. We know—we now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers, seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.
But American border problems won't be fixed until Congress acts. If we don't pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border—and a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers.
There's so much more to do, though. We need to come together on police reform and immigration reform. We need to protect—[applause]. We need to protect voting rights and the right to choose. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to reinstate Roe v. Wade and pass it nationally. We really do.
The United States has benefited greatly from waves of immigration from the Ireland—the island of Ireland, who helped shape this Nation: the Scottish-Irish of the 18th century; the Irish who came during the 19th century, like my ancestors, during the famine and beyond.
We'll also continue to work together as partners to keep our people safe. Keeping people safe also includes keeping asylum seekers safe, keeping our borders secure, and keeping our immigration system strong.
Our teams have worked hard to achieve this agreement. All of the work will make it possible to deter irregular immigration at our borders while at the same time we increase regular migration and immigration.
You know, the great waves of immigration that brought our ancestors to the United States in succeeding decades carried millions more Irishmen across the sea. Most of them arrived with little more than with hope in their hearts and strength of their dreams and beautiful memories of an emerald green isle, a home they would never fully leave behind.
Look, the purpose of what we're doing now is making legal immigration more streamlined, see illegal immigration shorter term improved, and move in a direction that people know that there's a legal way to get here and not a legal way. That what's underway now.

The President. No, look, what we want to do at the border is have it work and function in the way it's designed to work. And that requires us having more immigration officers, more asylum judges, a whole range of things. More personnel. And I'm trying to do as much of that as I can.

And we have to finally fix the broken immigration system, for God's sake.

First piece of legislation I introduced—on my first day in office, I sent an immigration reform bill to the Congress, one that recognizes immigrants' contributions to this country and provides a pathway to citizenship for "Dreamers," temporary status holders, farmworkers, and others.

We need our colleagues to act. For decades, immigration reform had been a bipartisan [issue; White House correction] in this country. Unfortunately, the MAGA Republicans in Congress and my predecessor spent 4 years gutting the immigration system—under my predecessor. They continue to undermine our border security today, blocking bipartisan reform.

So, until Congress acts, I'm going keep using every tool at my disposal as President of the United States to preserve and protect DACA, keep fighting for Dreamers, and build a safe, orderly, humane immigration system. [Applause] I mean it.

And, well, we have a lot of topics to discuss: the green transition, of course; immigration, migration; the economic development; and of course, some issues that are going on in this world that it's really hard nowadays. But I know with respecting human rights and fighting for democracy, we can reach some of the goals we share.
And three, enforcing our immigration laws in humane and effective ways that deter—that deters dangerous, irregular migration and disrupts traffickers.
On my very first day, I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress asking for a significant increase in the number of folks at the border—a significant increase in all the security we needed in terms of ti-tech [high-tech; White House correction] stuff.

Let me be clear: We need real solutions. I support real solutions at the border. I put forward a comprehensive plan the first day I came into office. I've made it clear that we need Congress to make changes to fix what is a broken immigration system, because we know—we all know it's broken.

And I'm willing to do significantly more. But in terms of changes of policy and to provide resources that we need at the border, I'm willing to deal—change policy as well. I've asked for billions of dollars for more border agents, more immigration judges, more asylum officers.

And I have repeatedly made clear, from our first day in office, we also need Ukraine to make changes to fix the broken immigration system here—we also need Congress to make the changes to fix the broken immigration system here at home.
Over and over, I've asked for resources to step up action at the border. In October, I asked Congress to fund—for funding that would add another 20 additional border—twenty—2,000 additional border agents and officers, hundreds of new immigration judges to make the judgments on the spot, a new—new detection equipment to stop fentanyl from coming into the country.
It includes an additional 1,300 Border Patrols—we need more agents on the border; 375 immigration judges to judge whether or not someone can come or not come and be fair about it; 1,600 asylum officers; and over 100 cutting-edge inspect—inject—inspection machines to help detect and stop fentanyl coming in our Southwest Border.
The President. For much too long, as you all know, the immigration system has been broken. And it's long past time to fix it.
That's why, months ago, I instructed my team to begin negotiations with a bipartisan group of Senators to seriously and finally fix our immigration system. For months now, that's what they've done, working around the clock, through the holidays, over the weekends. It's been an extraordinary effort by Senators Lankford, Murphy, and Sinema.
The result of all this hard work is a bipartisan agreement that represents the most fair, humane reforms in our immigration system in a long time and the toughest set of reforms to secure the border ever. Now all indications are, this bill won't even move forward to the Senate floor.
Because it's going to make the country safer, make the border more secure, treat people more humanely and freely—and fairly, and make legal immigration more efficient and consistent with the values of our Nation and our international treaty obligations.
An additional—100 additional immigration judges to help reduce the year-long asylum backlog. You show up for asylum and you get told a judge is supposed to talk to you. It takes a year to get that discussion going.
The bottom line is, this bipartisan bill is a win for America because it makes important fixes to our broken immigration system, and it's the toughest, fairest law that's ever been proposed relative to the border.
For example, we still need a path for—of documentation for those who are already here. And we're not walking away from true immigration reform, including permanent protections and a pathway to citizenship for young "Dreamers" who came here when they were children and who have been good citizens and contribute so much to our country.
The first bill I introduced when I got—became President was to reform the immigration system—the first one. They wouldn't touch it. And so we came along this time and Lankford, who they really threw the man—the man overboard, but they negotiated all through the entire vacation, all through—I mean, they just went straight through—weekends. And they finally reached an agreement.
But that's not all. Months ago, I instructed my team to begin negotiations with a bipartisan group of Senators—Democrats and Republicans—to finally fix our immigration system so it's fair and controllable. The result was a bipartisan agreement that represents the most fair, humane reforms to our immigration system in a long time.
The first bill I introduced as a Senator was to fix the immigration system. The very first thing—and I said, "Senator"—as President, I introduced. It would make the country safer, make our border more secure, but treat people fairly, ensure legal immigration consistent with our values as a nation and our international obligations. But Senate Republicans have blocked it now.
Folks, we've spent months working on a bipartisan border bill that included the most humane, fair reforms to our immigration system ever. It also included the toughest set of reforms to secure the border ever.
Look at what they're doing with the bipartisan immigration and border bill. We worked—I put together—we put together a group of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and the House. And we worked on this for 5 months—4 months, and we came up with an answer.

The first bill I ever introduced in the United States Senate—in the Congress as President was an immigration bill to provide them the means to be able to have enough judges, enough—enough Border Patrol, enough—down the line, they don't have it—enough technology to be able to determine whether fentanyl is being hidden, et cetera.

The bipartisan immigration and border bill gets passed after far—almost 5 weeks of negotiation—Democrat and Republican. It was a tough, tough deal. And I said I would support the outcome. Didn't have all that I wanted in it, but it makes—there were some real problems. They're short about two—about 3,000 workers down there, from Border Patrol to a whole range—the judges and the rest.
And this guy calls—immigrants—we have a problem with immigration. We need an orderly process. It's out of control. We can fix it. The first bill I ever introduced was a bill on immigration—on—the border, calling for more agents, more rational ways to deal with this issue.
Look what they're doing with the bipartisan immigration border law. We worked for 5 months to get that. The border is in chaos. The border—and the first bill I ever introduced as a—as President of the United States was on the border, on immigration. We need somewhere in an order—in excess of 2,000 additional personnel at the border—from judges to ICE to just the Border Patrol. They don't have the personnel.
There's one other piece of unfinished business I want to talk about: the border. My first day in office as President, the first bill I sent, I sent up a comprehensive plan to fix the immigration system.

Folks, Congress has had a long, proud history of—bipartisan history on immigration reform and abiding by our international treaty obligations, which we've signed, relating to immigration. These reforms made America a nation of laws, a nation of immigrants, and the strongest economy in the world.

But something changed. Over time, our laws and our resources haven't kept up with our immigration system, and it's broken. And our politics has failed to fix it.

That's why, months ago, I instructed my team to begin a series of negotiations in a bipartisan group of Senators, Democrats and—led by a very conservative Republican, who did a hell of a job, to fix our immigration system. I provided each of you, as I said, a fact sheet with the details of that bipartisan deal.

The Border Patrol chief himself said, "We need more people. We need more agents on the line." Our bipartisan bill got the Border Patrol the agents they need. It funds and hires 1,500 more agents and officers—1,500; 100 more immigration judges; 4,300 more asylum officers to get asylum decisions in months instead of years.

Look, it's the strongest border deal our country has ever seen. It also includes the most fair and humane reforms for legal immigration in a long time. Let's get it done.

Folks, on my first day as President, I introduced a bill I sent to Congress: a comprehensive plan to fix the broken immigration system and to secure the border. But no action was taken.
We also need more immigration judges to help handle the backlog. There are 2 million cases—a backlog of 2 million cases. This bipartisan deal would provide funding for a hundred more immigration judges immediately.
That bipartisan bill would hire 1,500 more security agents and officers, 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backload of 2 million cases, 4,300 more asylum officers, and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years now. What are you against?
Unlike my predecessor, on my first day in office, I introduced a comprehensive bill to fix our immigration system. Take a look at it. It has all these and more: secure the border, provide a pathway to citizenship for "Dreamers," and so much more.
No one should ever doubt where my heart is. Unlike Donald Trump, on my first day in office as President, I introduced a comprehensive plan to fix our immigration system, secure our border, provide a pathway for citizenship for "Dreamers" and their families, farmworkers, essential workers who helped us through the pandemic and are part of the fabric of our community.
That bipartisan deal would hire 1,500 more border security agents and officers; 1,000—100 more immigration judges to help tackle a backlog of 2 million cases that are just waiting to be heard; 4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly increase our ability to stop fentanyl from being smuggled into America. And by the way, no one questions those numbers.
With a group of bipartisan Senators, led by a very conservative Senator from Oklahoma, we agreed over a 5-week period to the strongest border law in American history: One thousand—[applause]—1,500 more border agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to hear the cases and the backlog—there's a backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years, which every study shows will discourage people from going to these cowboys and being—paying 8,000 bucks to be smuggled across, knowing—if you know you're not going to be looked at again for another 6 years, then you—come, but if you know you're going to be out in 6 weeks, it's a different thing; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines—what I've been calling for for a long time—to significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles from smuggling fentanyl into America.
With a group of bipartisan Senators we put together over a 5-month period, the very conservative—a very conservative Senator from Oklahoma heading the group—of a meeting for 5—5 solid weeks toward the end, we agreed on the strongest border security law in American history: 1,500 more Border Security agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers and new policy so they can resolve 6—issues in 6 months instead of, now, 6 years; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly decrease the ability to smuggle in fentanyl and all its precursors.
You know, with a group of bipartisan Senators, led by a very conservative Senator from Oklahoma, we negotiated for weeks and agreed on the strongest national security, border security law in American history: 1,500 more border security agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve all these cases in 6 months instead of 6 years, because it takes 6 to 8 years now to resolve these cases—it's chaos; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines that significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles from smuggling fentanyl into America.
Look, I proposed the most comprehensive immigration reform in decades while Trump is saying immigrants "poison the blood of the country," looking at many of you when he says it.
My first day in office, as I said, I sent a comprehensive immigration reform bill to Congress. It expands legal paths for entries for families and employers. It includes pathways to citizenship for Dreamers in the only country that they ever called home.
Folks, the reason why we're the fastest growing country in the world, why we're the best economy in the world is because of immigration. That's why we're—[inaudible]. That's not hyperbole, that's a fact.
Look, I proposed the most comprehensive immigration reform in decades, while Trump says immigrants are the—"poisoning the blood of America." Well, I wonder how many of us would be here if that was the case when our forefathers came—when our folks came. He says the biggest threat—the biggest threat is these—these criminals coming across the border.
You know, I proposed the strongest border bill ever—the most—most fair and humane immigration reform in decades. It includes a pathway to citizenship for "Dreamers" and more.
But after months of bipartisan negotiations, I proposed the strongest border bill ever, a comprehensive immigration reform—in decades—a bipartisan bill that would require us to hire 1,500 more security agents and officers at the border; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backload of 2 million cases—there's a backload of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years and to get decisions faster.
We're a nation of immigrants. That's why this bipartisan bill also includes fair and humane immigrant reform—immigration reform in decades—the most significant. It includes a pathway for citizenship for "Dreamers" and so much more.
Folks, that's not who we are. That's not America. And we—and it really hurts us around the world, not in terms of immigration but in terms of what kind of people we are.
But in the months—after months of bipartisan negotiations, with one of the most conservative Members of the United States Senate from Oklahoma leading it for the Republicans—after months of it, we finally came up with the strongest border bill and the most comprehensive immigration reform in decades.
First bill I introduced when I got elected President was a bill relating to the border. This bipartisan bill that we all agreed on would require 1,500 more—1,500 more security agents on the border; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backload of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers; new policies to resolve—that can be resolved in 6 months instead of 6 years.
We're a—look, we're a nation of immigrants. That's why the bipartisan bill also includes the most fair and humane immigration reforms in decades. It includes a pathway for citizenship for "Dreamers" and so much more.
And by the way, I proposed the most comprehensive immigration reform bill in decades. It includes a pathway to citizenship for "Dreamers" and expands the number of green cards so more families can build their American Dream together.
While we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, he calls immigrants "rapists" and "murderers." He says they are "not people"—they are "not people." He says immigrants are, quote, "poisoning the blood of our country." Folks, my predecessor wants a country just for some of us. We want a country for all of us.
And by the way, the first bill I introduced was the most comprehensive immigration reform bill in decades. It includes a pathway to citizenship for "Dreamers" and expands the number of green cards so many more families can build their American Dream together.
And while we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, Trump continues to vilify immigrants. I can't believe the way this guy talks. He talks about immigrants as "rapists" and "murderers"—his words, not mine. He said they are "not people"—they are "not people." He says immigrants are "poisoning the blood of this country."
And 2 weeks ago, the Department of Justice stated—started a new docket in the immigration courts to address cases where people who've recently crossed the border and make—they'll make a decision within 6 months rather than 6 years, because that's what happens now.
We're also sending additional Federal prosecutors to hot spots along the border and prosecute individuals who break our immigration laws.
But while these steps are important, they're not enough. To truly secure the border, we have to change our laws, and Congress needs to provide the necessary funding to hire 1,500 more border security agents; 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backlog of cases, more than 2 million of them; 4,300 more asylum officers to make decisions in less than 6 months instead of 6 years, which is what it takes now; and around 100 more high-tech detection machines to significantly increase the ability to screen and stop fentanyl being smuggled into the United States.
On my first—very first day as President, I introduced a comprehensive immigration reform plan to fix—to fix—our broken system, secure our border, provide a pathway for citizenship for "Dreamers," and a lot more. And I'm still fighting to get that done.
Today I've spoken about what we need to do to secure the border. In the weeks ahead—and I mean the weeks ahead—I will speak to how we can make our immigration system more fair and more just.
President Obama. Well—and, Joe, you also—for those Republicans who are trying to figure out what to do in this next election and are concerned, for example, about challenges at the border and immigration, it turns out that there was a bipartisan solution to help create a more orderly border and a more lawful system of immigration that the nominee of the other party decided to tank because he wanted it as an issue in this next election rather than to actually solve a problem.
The first bill I introduced when I was President was an immigration bill that included this provision, but it never got off the ground. It needed a little more help. But now, today, a significant portion of it is being passed—or being—by Executive order.
At the time I took these steps to secure the border, I also said that I would move to fix problems that made our immigration system unfair, unjust, and provisions that simply made it—no sense at all, specifically, steps that will be good for "Dreamers," married couples, and for Americans. That's why we're here today.
And here's the point: It doesn't require any fundamental change in our immigration law. There's already a system in place for people we're talking about today, but the process is cumbersome, risky, and it separates families.
Look, the Statue of Liberty is not some relic of American history. It stands—still stands for who we are. But I also refuse to believe that for us to continue to be America that embraces immigration, we have to give up securing our border. They're false choices. We can both secure the border and provide legal pathways to citizenship.
Folks, I'm not interested in playing politics with the border or immigration. I'm interested in fixing it.
We're going to protect our children and get the weapons of war off our streets. We're going to provide clean drinking water, affordable high-speed internet, quality education for every child in America. We're going to secure our border and protect legal immigration.
So that's when I took executive action. I said—and since I did the border, encounters have gone down over 50 percent. And we're going to keep it going down, fixing our legal immigration and creating pathways for citizenship for "Dreamers."
And unlike Trump, we will not demonize immigrants, saying they're the—"poison the blood of America"—[applause]—"poison the blood of our country." Kamala and I are committed to strengthening legal immigration, including protecting "Dreamers" and more.
Let me be clear: We believe in an immigration system that reflects our values. We don't demonize immigrants. We don't single them out for attacks. We don't believe they're poisoning the blood of the country. We're a nation of immigrants, and that's why we're so damn strong. (Applause.)
Friends, this is a big deal. It's the most important -- positive, important immigration action since Obama announced DACA when I was vice president.

My administration is also expanding access to legal representation and resources for people seeking legal status. We're working with all of you to ensure folks can have access to these services, just as we work together to fix our broken immigration system. We must do it.

Our politics once had a proud bipartisan tradition on immigrants -- on immigration. More recently, things have gotten worse. Every time we got close, MAGA Republicans blocked it to make it a campaign issue. They'd rather weaponize the problem than solve it.

As president, the first bill I sent to Congress when I got elected was a comprehensive immigration reform, after working with all of you. I'll work with anyone to get it done.

We must pass the John Lewis Voting Right Act -- (applause) -- and the Freedom to Vote Act -- (applause); stop the intimidation of Hispanic voters in Texas and elsewhere -- (applause); and let's defend your freedom to choose, restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land -- (applause) -- and pass comprehensive immigration reform. (Applause.)

His mismanagement of the pandemic devastated the Latino community. Trump is a failed businessman who drove up Latino unemployment and decimated Latino small businesses. And his attacks on legal immigration betr- -- betray what we stand for as a nation. He separated families at the border, ripping children from their parents. He banned people based on their faith.

And it's a job that plays a critical role in fixing our broken immigration system.

And while DHS affects everyone, given its critical role in immigration matters, I am proud that for the first time ever, the Department will be led by an immigrant, a Latino, who knows that we are a nation of laws and values.

And here's what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to America. Let's end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we've done nothing about it. It's time to fix it.
On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 11 million undocumented folks—the vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it. We can actually—if you actually want to solve a problem, I've sent a bill to—so take a close look at it.
Look, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let's argue over it, let's debate it, but let's act.
Mr. Lemon. I want to talk to you about DACA. I've got two questions on immigration. They're quick questions I want to ask you about. Because just last week, there was a Federal judge who ruled the program unlawful, blocked it from accepting new applications. What do you say to DREAMers who are really worried about their futures here in the United States?
Operation Allies Refugee [Refuge],* which I announced back in July, has already moved 2,000 Afghans who are eligible for special immigration visas and their families to the United States. In the coming days, the U.S. military will provide assistance to move more SIV-eligible Afghans and their families out of Afghanistan.
Unfortunately, such hate-fueled violence and threats are not new to America. There is a through-line of hate from massacres of Indigenous people to the original sin of slavery, the terror of the Klan, to anti-immigration violence against the Irish, Italians, Chinese, Mexicans, and so many others laced throughout our history. There is a through-line of violence against religious groups: anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic, anti-Mormon, anti-Muslim, anti-Hindu, anti-Sikh.
But there's more to do. As was mentioned by the—by your president, immigration is another major issue affecting many of your communities, particularly border communities and near—and near communities.
The first bill I introduced was a comprehensive reform legislation on immigration. But because of some in the Congress, they refused to consider it. They found it a better issue to campaign on than an issue to solve.
So we have a choice: They can keep using immigration to try to score political points, or we can help solve the problem. Immigration reform used to be a bipartisan issue. And we can make it that again, in my view.
We'll also continue to work together as partners to keep our people safe. Keeping people safe also includes keeping asylum seekers safe, keeping our borders secure, and keeping our immigration system strong.
Our teams have worked hard to achieve this agreement. All of the work will make it possible to deter irregular immigration at our borders while at the same time we increase regular migration and immigration.
