And let's also come together on immigration. Make it a bipartisan issue once again. We know—we now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers, seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.
But American border problems won't be fixed until Congress acts. If we don't pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border—and a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers.
On my very first day, I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress asking for a significant increase in the number of folks at the border—a significant increase in all the security we needed in terms of ti-tech [high-tech; White House correction] stuff.

It includes an additional 1,300 Border Patrols—we need more agents on the border; 375 immigration judges to judge whether or not someone can come or not come and be fair about it; 1,600 asylum officers; and over 100 cutting-edge inspect—inject—inspection machines to help detect and stop fentanyl coming in our Southwest Border.
A bipartisan bill would be good for America and help fix our broken immigration system and allow speedy access for those who deserve to be here. And Congress needs to get it done.
But that's not all. Months ago, I instructed my team to begin negotiations with a bipartisan group of Senators—Democrats and Republicans—to finally fix our immigration system so it's fair and controllable. The result was a bipartisan agreement that represents the most fair, humane reforms to our immigration system in a long time.
The first bill I introduced as a Senator was to fix the immigration system. The very first thing—and I said, "Senator"—as President, I introduced. It would make the country safer, make our border more secure, but treat people fairly, ensure legal immigration consistent with our values as a nation and our international obligations. But Senate Republicans have blocked it now.
With a group of bipartisan Senators we put together over a 5-month period, the very conservative—a very conservative Senator from Oklahoma heading the group—of a meeting for 5—5 solid weeks toward the end, we agreed on the strongest border security law in American history: 1,500 more Border Security agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers and new policy so they can resolve 6—issues in 6 months instead of, now, 6 years; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly decrease the ability to smuggle in fentanyl and all its precursors.
Look, I proposed the most comprehensive immigration reform in decades while Trump is saying immigrants "poison the blood of the country," looking at many of you when he says it.
My first day in office, as I said, I sent a comprehensive immigration reform bill to Congress. It expands legal paths for entries for families and employers. It includes pathways to citizenship for Dreamers in the only country that they ever called home.
I want to thank President López Obrador for his partnership. We've become friends. I talk to him all the—he's helping on immigration. We have a significant economic security, as well as security overall.
Folks, the reason why we're the fastest growing country in the world, why we're the best economy in the world is because of immigration. That's why we're—[inaudible]. That's not hyperbole, that's a fact.
But after months of bipartisan negotiations, I proposed the strongest border bill ever, a comprehensive immigration reform—in decades—a bipartisan bill that would require us to hire 1,500 more security agents and officers at the border; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backload of 2 million cases—there's a backload of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years and to get decisions faster.
We're a nation of immigrants. That's why this bipartisan bill also includes fair and humane immigrant reform—immigration reform in decades—the most significant. It includes a pathway for citizenship for "Dreamers" and so much more.
Folks, that's not who we are. That's not America. And we—and it really hurts us around the world, not in terms of immigration but in terms of what kind of people we are.
But in the months—after months of bipartisan negotiations, with one of the most conservative Members of the United States Senate from Oklahoma leading it for the Republicans—after months of it, we finally came up with the strongest border bill and the most comprehensive immigration reform in decades.
First bill I introduced when I got elected President was a bill relating to the border. This bipartisan bill that we all agreed on would require 1,500 more—1,500 more security agents on the border; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backload of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers; new policies to resolve—that can be resolved in 6 months instead of 6 years.
We're a—look, we're a nation of immigrants. That's why the bipartisan bill also includes the most fair and humane immigration reforms in decades. It includes a pathway for citizenship for "Dreamers" and so much more.
President Obama. Well—and, Joe, you also—for those Republicans who are trying to figure out what to do in this next election and are concerned, for example, about challenges at the border and immigration, it turns out that there was a bipartisan solution to help create a more orderly border and a more lawful system of immigration that the nominee of the other party decided to tank because he wanted it as an issue in this next election rather than to actually solve a problem.
TAPPER: President Trump, we will get to immigration later in this block. President Biden, I want to give you an opportunity to respond to this question about the national debt.
TAPPER: Let's turn now to the issue of immigration and border security. President Biden, a record number of migrants have illegally crossed the southern border on your watch, overwhelming border states and overburdening cities such as New York and Chicago, and in some cases causing real safety and security concerns.
TAPPER: President Trump, staying on the topic of immigration, you've said that you're going to carry out, quote, "the largest domestic deportation operation in American history," unquote.
We're going to protect our children and get the weapons of war off our streets. We're going to provide clean drinking water, affordable high-speed internet, quality education for every child in America. We're going to secure our border and protect legal immigration.
So that's when I took executive action. I said—and since I did the border, encounters have gone down over 50 percent. And we're going to keep it going down, fixing our legal immigration and creating pathways for citizenship for "Dreamers."
And unlike Trump, we will not demonize immigrants, saying they're the—"poison the blood of America"—[applause]—"poison the blood of our country." Kamala and I are committed to strengthening legal immigration, including protecting "Dreamers" and more.
Mr. Cooper. Let me ask about—a question which does often divide many people in this country: immigration.
Mr. Cooper. Your administration, along with congressional Democrats, expected to unveil an immigration reform bill just this week. You want a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants. Would you sign any immigration bill if it did not include that: a pathway for the roughly 11 million undocumented——
The President. Yes, there's a whole range of things that relate to immigration, including the whole idea how you deal with—you know, what confuses people, is you talk about refugees, you talk about undocumented, you talk about people who are seeking asylum, and you talk about people who are coming from the—that are coming from camps or being held around the world.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I'd like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your Presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff, united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people?
And the other problems we're talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they've been around a long time. And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and—whether it's immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.
Q. And just to follow up, Mr. President, can your Presidency be a success if you can't make progress on those four challenges: climate change, immigration reform, gun control, voting rights?
The President. No, no, but I mean—I don't know how much detail you want about immigration. Maybe I'll stop there, and finish——
And in addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what Zeke was asking about, there's—immigration is a big issue, of course, when it—related to the filibuster, but there's also Republicans who are passing bill after bill, trying to restrict voting rights. Chuck Schumer is calling it an "existential threat" to democracy. Why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues including voting rights or immigration?
Q. I'd like to circle back to immigration, please. You just listed the reasons that people are coming, talking about in-country problems, saying that it happens every year; you blamed the last administration. Sir, I just got back last night from a reporting trip to the border where I met nine-year-old Yossell, who walked here from Honduras by himself, along with another little boy. He had that phone number on him——
The President. First of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all—did not slow up the amount of immigration—and there's many people coming.
Q. If I may ask one last question: Have you had any talks with Senate Republicans who are threatening this administration with not considering the immigration legislation that was passed in the House until the situation at the border has been resolved?
And here's what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to America. Let's end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we've done nothing about it. It's time to fix it.
On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 11 million undocumented folks—the vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it. We can actually—if you actually want to solve a problem, I've sent a bill to—so take a close look at it.
Look, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let's argue over it, let's debate it, but let's act.
And finally, there's much more to be done and so much more to do—tackling voting rights, which is an existential threat to democracy right now. The things that are being asked are just beyond the pale. And the Vice President has been working hard on this issue and is going to continue to—we all are—but there's much more to do. We have to tackle the immigration problem, which we're working really hard to get done in a humane and serious way. Police reform and crime.
Q. Good evening, Mr. President. Vice President Harris said to Guatemalans, "Don't come." Recently, you have indicated you are in favor of refugees coming to this country. Could you please explain your administration's basic stance on immigration?
Mr. Lemon. I want to talk to you about DACA. I've got two questions on immigration. They're quick questions I want to ask you about. Because just last week, there was a Federal judge who ruled the program unlawful, blocked it from accepting new applications. What do you say to DREAMers who are really worried about their futures here in the United States?
People do it because they're desperate. They're desperate. And what I've been trying to do and I'm trying to do in this legislation as well is get funding so we have funding for immigration officers to be able to hear cases immediately of whether or not they justify having asylum granted to them.

I think that this—the fundamental question is: What's Mitch for? What's he for on immigration? What's he for? What's he proposing to make anything better? What's he for dealing with Russia that's different than I'm proposing and many of his Republican friends or his colleagues are supporting as well? What's he for on these things? What are they for?
I think they—look, I've laid out a proposal on immigration that if we passed it, we'd be in a totally different place right now. But we're not there because we don't have a single Republican vote. My buddy John McCain is gone.
And I think that's where we are again. And I think we have a chance to sort of restate and reassert our world leadership on a whole range of issues and lead the world on everything from the environment to dealing with the issues of immigration, a whole range of issues, Gov.
Folks, if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure our border and fix the immigration system.
The President. And as you might guess, I think we can do both. At our border, we've installed new technology, like cutting-edge scanners, to better detect drug smuggling. We've set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers. We're putting in place dedicated immigration judges in significant larger number so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases—cases heard faster—and those who don't [aren't]* legitimately here can be sent back.
It's not only the right thing to do, it's economically smart thing to do. That's why the immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Let's get it done once and for all.
Look, we're working to fix our immigration system to reflect our values and the truth that legal immigration defines who we are as a nation—who we are as a nation. That's why we're so darn strong.
Now, look, as was mentioned by all of us in one way or another, this has been the greatest migration in human history around the world, as well as in this hemisphere. And when I got elected, the first thing I—the first major piece of legislation I introduced was to reform the immigration process, to make it more orderly, to make it more—to make sure people have access under the law.
We have—we can do more than merely just make legal immigration more streamlined. But we can also do it by preventing people from wanting to have to leave in the first place, by helping their communities, in fact, better their circumstances.
But there's more to do. As was mentioned by the—by your president, immigration is another major issue affecting many of your communities, particularly border communities and near—and near communities.
I visited the border earlier this month, the first time as President. I've been there before, but for the first time as President. And I'm taking action where I have the legal capacity to do so. I'll continue to call on Congress to act to pass comprehensive immigration reform to fix the system.
The first bill I introduced was a comprehensive reform legislation on immigration. But because of some in the Congress, they refused to consider it. They found it a better issue to campaign on than an issue to solve.
So we have a choice: They can keep using immigration to try to score political points, or we can help solve the problem. Immigration reform used to be a bipartisan issue. And we can make it that again, in my view.
And let's also come together on immigration. Make it a bipartisan issue once again. We know—we now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers, seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.
But American border problems won't be fixed until Congress acts. If we don't pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border—and a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers.
I've been clear from the very beginning: The system is broken. My first day in office, I sent Congress a comprehensive plan on immigration reform. My friends on the other side have done nothing with that.
Over and over, I've asked for resources to step up action at the border. In October, I asked Congress to fund—for funding that would add another 20 additional border—twenty—2,000 additional border agents and officers, hundreds of new immigration judges to make the judgments on the spot, a new—new detection equipment to stop fentanyl from coming into the country.
Folks, we've spent months working on a bipartisan border bill that included the most humane, fair reforms to our immigration system ever. It also included the toughest set of reforms to secure the border ever.
There's one other piece of unfinished business I want to talk about: the border. My first day in office as President, the first bill I sent, I sent up a comprehensive plan to fix the immigration system.

Folks, Congress has had a long, proud history of—bipartisan history on immigration reform and abiding by our international treaty obligations, which we've signed, relating to immigration. These reforms made America a nation of laws, a nation of immigrants, and the strongest economy in the world.

But something changed. Over time, our laws and our resources haven't kept up with our immigration system, and it's broken. And our politics has failed to fix it.

That's why, months ago, I instructed my team to begin a series of negotiations in a bipartisan group of Senators, Democrats and—led by a very conservative Republican, who did a hell of a job, to fix our immigration system. I provided each of you, as I said, a fact sheet with the details of that bipartisan deal.

The Border Patrol chief himself said, "We need more people. We need more agents on the line." Our bipartisan bill got the Border Patrol the agents they need. It funds and hires 1,500 more agents and officers—1,500; 100 more immigration judges; 4,300 more asylum officers to get asylum decisions in months instead of years.

Look, it's the strongest border deal our country has ever seen. It also includes the most fair and humane reforms for legal immigration in a long time. Let's get it done.

That bipartisan bill would hire 1,500 more security agents and officers, 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backload of 2 million cases, 4,300 more asylum officers, and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years now. What are you against?
Unlike my predecessor, on my first day in office, I introduced a comprehensive bill to fix our immigration system. Take a look at it. It has all these and more: secure the border, provide a pathway to citizenship for "Dreamers," and so much more.
That bipartisan deal would hire 1,500 more border security agents and officers; 1,000—100 more immigration judges to help tackle a backlog of 2 million cases that are just waiting to be heard; 4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly increase our ability to stop fentanyl from being smuggled into America. And by the way, no one questions those numbers.
And by the way, I proposed the most comprehensive immigration reform bill in decades. It includes a pathway to citizenship for "Dreamers" and expands the number of green cards so more families can build their American Dream together.
While we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, he calls immigrants "rapists" and "murderers." He says they are "not people"—they are "not people." He says immigrants are, quote, "poisoning the blood of our country." Folks, my predecessor wants a country just for some of us. We want a country for all of us.
And by the way, the first bill I introduced was the most comprehensive immigration reform bill in decades. It includes a pathway to citizenship for "Dreamers" and expands the number of green cards so many more families can build their American Dream together.
And while we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, Trump continues to vilify immigrants. I can't believe the way this guy talks. He talks about immigrants as "rapists" and "murderers"—his words, not mine. He said they are "not people"—they are "not people." He says immigrants are "poisoning the blood of this country."
TAPPER: President Trump, we will get to immigration later in this block. President Biden, I want to give you an opportunity to respond to this question about the national debt.

We're going to protect our children and get the weapons of war off our streets. We're going to provide clean drinking water, affordable high-speed internet, quality education for every child in America. We're going to secure our border and protect legal immigration.
With child care and elder care that make it possible for parents to go to work and for the elderly to stay in their homes with dignity. With an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values. With newly empowered labor unions. With equal pay for women. With rising wages you can raise a family on. Yes, we're going to do more than praise our essential workers. We're finally going to pay them.
Mr. Cooper. Let me ask about—a question which does often divide many people in this country: immigration.

For example, I know that this week you're working on the "Protect Our Democracy" reforms, as well as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act—both of which I strongly support. And I know that, in the past couple of days, you've had briefings and conversations on immigration, health care, foreign policy, climate crisis, and a lot more. And as you work on all of these, I urge you to continue to speak up and speak out about the American Rescue Plan.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I'd like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your Presidency.

Q. And, Mr. President, just really quickly. A lot of people have been trying to attach immigration——
People do it because they're desperate. They're desperate. And what I've been trying to do and I'm trying to do in this legislation as well is get funding so we have funding for immigration officers to be able to hear cases immediately of whether or not they justify having asylum granted to them.

That's why I wrote these bills in the first place. That's why it will matter so much when I sign them into law, because of you. And there's so much more to do: protecting the sacred right to vote, immigration, the courts, building on the Affordable Care Act, protecting a woman's right to choose, and so much more.
I think that this—the fundamental question is: What's Mitch for? What's he for on immigration? What's he for? What's he proposing to make anything better?

We're going to continue to stand up to meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate change, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more.
The President. No, no, I'm serious. Think of what they—and they're saying. They're not kidding about it. And we haven't even talked about voting rights and gun violence and criminal justice, immigration. All things—and we just have—you know, the good news is we have 50 Senators and the Vice President. And the bad news is, there are 51 Presidents. [Laughter] Any one can declare themselves President, as two Democrats have.
And we're working to fix our immigration system as well. As I said—[applause]—it's important. As I said in my State of the Union Address, we can secure our borders and keep lit the torch of liberty. On my first day in office, I sent an immigration bill to Congress that would provide a pathway to citizenship for immigrants contributing to our economy. That's—we are—we—you know, we are an immigrant nation. I mean, we literally—I mean, we say that, but people act like they don't believe it. We are an immigrant—and that is our strength. That is our strength.

Q. Good evening, Mr. President. Vice President Harris said to Guatemalans, "Don't come." Recently, you have indicated you are in favor of refugees coming to this country. Could you please explain your administration's basic stance on immigration?
Mr. Lemon. I want to talk to you about DACA. I've got two questions on immigration. They're quick questions I want to ask you about. Because just last week, there was a Federal judge who ruled the program unlawful, blocked it from accepting new applications. What do you say to DREAMers who are really worried about their futures here in the United States?
The President. Okay. Well, everybody, welcome. Today I have the privilege of meeting with Latino leaders to discuss a bunch of key issues that affect the community; the progress we're making against the pandemic; historic and economic recovery we're under—that's undergoing—we're undergoing; and immigration and voting rights, which are critical.
And, folks, there's so much more to do: police reform, criminal justice reform, immigration, gun violence, the courts, protecting a woman's right to choose. All these critical issues.
And I think that's where we are again. And I think we have a chance to sort of restate and reassert our world leadership on a whole range of issues and lead the world on everything from the environment to dealing with the issues of immigration, a whole range of issues, Gov.
Folks, if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure our border and fix the immigration system.
The President. And as you might guess, I think we can do both. At our border, we've installed new technology, like cutting-edge scanners, to better detect drug smuggling. We've set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers. We're putting in place dedicated immigration judges in significant larger number so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases—cases heard faster—and those who don't [aren't]* legitimately here can be sent back.
It's not only the right thing to do, it's economically smart thing to do. That's why the immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Let's get it done once and for all.
We're going to improve the lives of millions of Americans. We'll meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate crisis, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more. It's literally within our power to do this. And we can make sure that this Nation is going to continue to be what it's always been.
We're going to continue to stand up to meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate change, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more.
The President. No, no, I'm serious. Think of what they—and they're saying. They're not kidding about it. And we haven't even talked about voting rights and gun violence and criminal justice, immigration. All things—and we just have—you know, the good news is we have 50 Senators and the Vice President. And the bad news is, there are 51 Presidents. [Laughter] Any one can declare themselves President, as two Democrats have.
You know, that's all of you. That's the incredible South Asian community all across America: Helping us emerge stronger from this pandemic. Building an economy that works for everyone. Teaching our children and caring for our elders. Responding to the cry for action on climate. Working to fix our immigration system. Defending rights and freedoms. Building a more just and equitable country. Serving and protecting our communities and our Nation. Informing, entertaining, inspiring.
And let's also come together on immigration. Make it a bipartisan issue once again. We know—we now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers, seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.
But American border problems won't be fixed until Congress acts. If we don't pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border—and a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers.
I've been clear from the very beginning: The system is broken. My first day in office, I sent Congress a comprehensive plan on immigration reform. My friends on the other side have done nothing with that.
Over and over, I've asked for resources to step up action at the border. In October, I asked Congress to fund—for funding that would add another 20 additional border—twenty—2,000 additional border agents and officers, hundreds of new immigration judges to make the judgments on the spot, a new—new detection equipment to stop fentanyl from coming into the country.
That bipartisan bill would hire 1,500 more security agents and officers, 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backload of 2 million cases, 4,300 more asylum officers, and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years now. What are you against?
Unlike my predecessor, on my first day in office, I introduced a comprehensive bill to fix our immigration system. Take a look at it. It has all these and more: secure the border, provide a pathway to citizenship for "Dreamers," and so much more.
No one should ever doubt where my heart is. Unlike Donald Trump, on my first day in office as President, I introduced a comprehensive plan to fix our immigration system, secure our border, provide a pathway for citizenship for "Dreamers" and their families, farmworkers, essential workers who helped us through the pandemic and are part of the fabric of our community.
With a group of bipartisan Senators, led by a very conservative Senator from Oklahoma, we agreed over a 5-week period to the strongest border law in American history: One thousand—[applause]—1,500 more border agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to hear the cases and the backlog—there's a backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years, which every study shows will discourage people from going to these cowboys and being—paying 8,000 bucks to be smuggled across, knowing—if you know you're not going to be looked at again for another 6 years, then you—come, but if you know you're going to be out in 6 weeks, it's a different thing; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines—what I've been calling for for a long time—to significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles from smuggling fentanyl into America.
With a group of bipartisan Senators we put together over a 5-month period, the very conservative—a very conservative Senator from Oklahoma heading the group—of a meeting for 5—5 solid weeks toward the end, we agreed on the strongest border security law in American history: 1,500 more Border Security agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers and new policy so they can resolve 6—issues in 6 months instead of, now, 6 years; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly decrease the ability to smuggle in fentanyl and all its precursors.
You know, with a group of bipartisan Senators, led by a very conservative Senator from Oklahoma, we negotiated for weeks and agreed on the strongest national security, border security law in American history: 1,500 more border security agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve all these cases in 6 months instead of 6 years, because it takes 6 to 8 years now to resolve these cases—it's chaos; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines that significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles from smuggling fentanyl into America.
Look, I proposed the most comprehensive immigration reform in decades, while Trump says immigrants are the—"poisoning the blood of America." Well, I wonder how many of us would be here if that was the case when our forefathers came—when our folks came. He says the biggest threat—the biggest threat is these—these criminals coming across the border.
President Obama. Well—and, Joe, you also—for those Republicans who are trying to figure out what to do in this next election and are concerned, for example, about challenges at the border and immigration, it turns out that there was a bipartisan solution to help create a more orderly border and a more lawful system of immigration that the nominee of the other party decided to tank because he wanted it as an issue in this next election rather than to actually solve a problem.
TAPPER: President Trump, we will get to immigration later in this block. President Biden, I want to give you an opportunity to respond to this question about the national debt.
TAPPER: Let's turn now to the issue of immigration and border security. President Biden, a record number of migrants have illegally crossed the southern border on your watch, overwhelming border states and overburdening cities such as New York and Chicago, and in some cases causing real safety and security concerns.
TAPPER: President Trump, staying on the topic of immigration, you've said that you're going to carry out, quote, "the largest domestic deportation operation in American history," unquote.
And it's a job that plays a critical role in fixing our broken immigration system.

And while DHS affects everyone, given its critical role in immigration matters, I am proud that for the first time ever, the Department will be led by an immigrant, a Latino, who knows that we are a nation of laws and values.

And here's what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to America. Let's end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we've done nothing about it. It's time to fix it.
On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 11 million undocumented folks—the vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it. We can actually—if you actually want to solve a problem, I've sent a bill to—so take a close look at it.
Look, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let's argue over it, let's debate it, but let's act.

Operation Allies Refugee [Refuge],* which I announced back in July, has already moved 2,000 Afghans who are eligible for special immigration visas and their families to the United States. In the coming days, the U.S. military will provide assistance to move more SIV-eligible Afghans and their families out of Afghanistan.
Q. And, Mr. President, just really quickly. A lot of people have been trying to attach immigration——
Unfortunately, such hate-fueled violence and threats are not new to America. There is a through-line of hate from massacres of Indigenous people to the original sin of slavery, the terror of the Klan, to anti-immigration violence against the Irish, Italians, Chinese, Mexicans, and so many others laced throughout our history. There is a through-line of violence against religious groups: anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic, anti-Mormon, anti-Muslim, anti-Hindu, anti-Sikh.
But there's more to do. As was mentioned by the—by your president, immigration is another major issue affecting many of your communities, particularly border communities and near—and near communities.
I visited the border earlier this month, the first time as President. I've been there before, but for the first time as President. And I'm taking action where I have the legal capacity to do so. I'll continue to call on Congress to act to pass comprehensive immigration reform to fix the system.
The first bill I introduced was a comprehensive reform legislation on immigration. But because of some in the Congress, they refused to consider it. They found it a better issue to campaign on than an issue to solve.
So we have a choice: They can keep using immigration to try to score political points, or we can help solve the problem. Immigration reform used to be a bipartisan issue. And we can make it that again, in my view.
We'll also continue to work together as partners to keep our people safe. Keeping people safe also includes keeping asylum seekers safe, keeping our borders secure, and keeping our immigration system strong.
Our teams have worked hard to achieve this agreement. All of the work will make it possible to deter irregular immigration at our borders while at the same time we increase regular migration and immigration.
