The point is that we've said to them, "Here's the deal: We're going to allow you to have a profit on what you make, but not the exorbitant prices that you're charging for the oil now." We've delegated a commission—a group of our—[inaudible]—sherpa—our national security people to sit down and work out that mechanism. We think it can be done. We think it can be done, and it would drive down the price of oil, and it would drive down the price of gasoline as well.
Q. Are you concerned national security could have been compromised at Mar-a-Lago?
When I return from the G-20 meetings in Indonesia with other world leaders, I'm going to invite the leaders of both political parties, as I've done in the past on my foreign trips, to the White House to discuss how we can work together for the remainder of this year and into the next Congress to advance the economic and national security priorities of the United States.
Sorry, I actually have an unrelated question too. Mr. President, do you think Elon Musk is a threat to U.S. national security? And should the U.S.—and with the tools you have—investigate his joint acquisition of Twitter with foreign governments, which include the Saudis?
I explained that, based on our national security strategy, Japan is determined to strengthen our defense force through position of counterstrike capabilities, increase our defense budget and other initiatives, and was reassured by President Biden of his strong support for such efforts.
You know, Sam and I came the same year to the United States Senate, and we served together a long, long time. I got there in January of 1973. And you know, I can say without fear of contradiction there wasn't a single Member on either of the aisle that didn't respect Sam Nunn's judgement, his integrity. And the thing the most known about Sam was he was a man of absolute, total integrity. But he also was the most informed man on foreign policy and national security of anybody I've ever served with and continues to be.
The Secretary of Defense can tell you—and those of you on—who work on national security issues know—the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA—the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. The people who set up before I came here—and that's been a long time ago—to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security—that's their only job. And it's a semiseparate agency; it's under the Defense Department. It's led to everything from the discovery of the internet to GPS and so much more that's enhanced our security.
This is not who we are. And I'll say one last thing—and you're going to—I've had a lot of experience internationally. And I mean that—not good or bad, just I have; I've chaired the Foreign Relations Committee. I've been deeply involved. I did national security for the—our last—the administration with Barack.
And I'd like to add a word about another investment this bill makes, one that I expect will pay dividends for hope, healing, and for our economy for generations to come. And it's called ARPA-H, Advanced Research Project Agencies of Health. This will be a new kind of entity, an engine for innovation, a place where we'll do high-risk, high-reward research that can drive unprecedented progress in biomedicine. It's based on DARPA, the Defense Department's Advanced Research Project Agency, that has led to breakthroughs in technologies that protect our national security, like the internet, GPS, and so much more.
Security also means national and international security. This budget provides the resources we need to keep Americans safe, ensuring that our military remains the best prepared, best trained, best equipped military in the world.
And this will be among the largest investments in our national security in history. Some people don't like the increase, but we're in a different world today. America is more prosperous, more successful, and more just when it is more secure. We can restore fiscal responsibility and safeguard our security at home and abroad while meeting a third value, what I call "building a better America."
When I return from the G-20 meetings in Indonesia with other world leaders, I'm going to invite the leaders of both political parties, as I've done in the past on my foreign trips, to the White House to discuss how we can work together for the remainder of this year and into the next Congress to advance the economic and national security priorities of the United States.
Sorry, I actually have an unrelated question too. Mr. President, do you think Elon Musk is a threat to U.S. national security? And should the U.S.—and with the tools you have—investigate his joint acquisition of Twitter with foreign governments, which include the Saudis?
For Prime Minister Trudeau, there's been a suggestion that Canada lead a multinational security force in Haiti. I wondered if that was a possibility and what you would need.
Mayor Jones. Great. Great. Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS and Science Act, we're seeing jobs return to our cities, and we're preparing our citizens for the many opportunities to come. What can we as mayors do to help you further your agenda of shoring up our national security and bring more high-quality jobs to America's cities?
Folks, we haven't even talked about my budget for our national security or our intelligence and foreign policy communities. My budget makes robust investments in our military and defense.
Just a few months ago, after a long negotiation between myself and the new Speaker, we agreed to spending levels. The Government will fund essential domestic and national security priorities, while still—while still—cutting the deficit by $1 trillion over the next decade. Now, a small group of extreme Republicans don't want to live up to the deal. So now everyone in America could be forced to pay the price.
But let me be clear: The House of Representatives must pass the bipartisan national security bill. The bill provides urgent funding for Ukraine, and it passed overwhelmingly in the Senate. And there's no question—none, none—if the Speaker called for a vote in the House, it would pass easily today. Instead, they went on vacation. I mean, it's just—any—well—[laughter].

I say this to Congress: We have to stand up to Putin. Send me a bipartisan national security bill. History is literally watching. History is watching. If the United States walks away, it will put Ukraine at risk. Europe is at risk. The free world will be at risk, emboldening others to do what they wish to do us harm.
The point is that we've said to them, "Here's the deal: We're going to allow you to have a profit on what you make, but not the exorbitant prices that you're charging for the oil now." We've delegated a commission—a group of our—[inaudible]—sherpa—our national security people to sit down and work out that mechanism. We think it can be done. We think it can be done, and it would drive down the price of oil, and it would drive down the price of gasoline as well.
We're modernizing our military alliance, building on Japan's historic increase in defense spending and new national security strategy.
And Japan and the United States are currently facing the most challenging and complex security environment in recent history. And in order to ensure our peace and prosperity in the region and to contribute to that and also safeguard peace and security of Japan, in late last year, Japan formulated a new national security strategy.
So today we're releasing a new plan to equip our economic partnership for the 21st century. It outlines how we can enhance our cooperation to accelerate the clean energy transition that must take place and is taking place, lead the development of—on—of emerging technologies that are going to shape so much of our future, and protect technologies critical to our national security.
And that begins with our highest priority: national security. Last time I was here in the U.S., we signed AUKUS, the most significant defense partnership in generations, because we recognize that the security of the Atlantic and Pacific regions are indivisible.
And just as we collaborate to protect our national security, so must we increasingly do the same to protect our economic security on which our prosperity depends.
And we're also addressing the national security risk posed by certain types of outbound investments. I had a discussion with Xi Jinping in China: Why was I not transferring certain technological capabilities? And I said, very simply, "Because you're using them for weapons of mass destruction and intelligence intervention." And I said, "If we can work out something on that, we'd have a very different relationship."
And so we're—but it's not nearly enough what we're—I'm announcing today. Congress must pass the bipartisan national security bill now, which includes urgent funding for Ukraine. We must act before it literally is too late—before it's too late. Because as Poland remembers, Russia won't stop at Ukraine. Putin will keep going, putting Europe, the United States, and the entire free world at risk, in my view.
Last week, I announced nominations and staff for critical foreign policy and national security positions. A first-rate team that will keep us safe and secure.

A skilled leader and thinker on issues ranging from macroeconomics to consumer protection, and from national security to international affairs.

She will work closely with my economic, national security, and foreign policy teams.

Together, they will align domestic policy, economic policy, and national security unlike ever before.

The Secretary of Defense can tell you—and those of you on—who work on national security issues know—the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA—the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. The people who set up before I came here—and that's been a long time ago—to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security—that's their only job. And it's a semiseparate agency; it's under the Defense Department. It's led to everything from the discovery of the internet to GPS and so much more that's enhanced our security.
The President. My national security staff and Defense staff has been in constant contact with their counterparts in the Middle East—not just with the Israelis, but also with everyone from the Egyptians, to the Saudis, to the Emiratis, et cetera.
This is not who we are. And I'll say one last thing—and you're going to—I've had a lot of experience internationally. And I mean that—not good or bad, just I have; I've chaired the Foreign Relations Committee. I've been deeply involved. I did national security for the—our last—the administration with Barack.
And you'd be amazed—as I traveled the world as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee or member of the Intelligence Committee for all those years, or as Vice President of the United States dealing with national security issues, or as President of the United States—how many of now my foreign counterparts thank you for what you do.
But I also know that your work is invaluable to our ability to make informed, strategic national security decisions. And I just had an interesting meeting, as you all know, with my very close friend, Vladimir Putin. [Laughter] I can tell the—one thing: I've been dealing with world leaders a long, long time. And just like all of you men and women, you can sort of sense somebody else after a while.
Q. Pandora Papers. The Pandora Papers. You had said that you put fight against corruption in the core of your national security policy. So what is your reaction? And do you plan to do anything about it?
And I want to thank the substantial bipartisan vote in the Senate for sending this bill to my desk today to avoid disruption of Government operations. And I want to urge Congress to use the time this bill provides to work toward a bipartisan agreement on a full-year funding bill that makes the needed investments in our economy and our people, from public health, to education, to national security.
It's based on DARPA. Most everybody knows, in this town, what DARPA is. That's the Defense Department's Advanced Research Project Agency that has led to breakthrough technologies that protect our national security, from the internet to GPS and so much more.
So we're creating a new "price preference." What this means is that if we're identifying some product that is so critical to our national security, health, or resilience, that we're going to create rules that allow us to pay a little more for them if they're made in America.
We should never be in that position again. And the bottom line is this bipartisan innovation bill will allow us to stamp more products "Made in America". And it's going to bolster our national security and our economic security. It matters, so let's get it done.
This innovation bill—ultimate bill that comes together is a key part of our futures. It's a key part of a Midwestern microelectronics corridor, if you will, that has everything to do with economic development and national security.
If I'd told those of you who are closer to my age in the audience—if we told your parents that we'd be here, they'd look at—like you were crazy. "What do you mean? We're the leader in the world." Not so. Congress needs to get this bill to my desk as quickly as possible. Our economic strength is on the line. And national security as well is on the line.
You know—and she mentored generations of rising foreign policy experts, the, quote, "foreign policy establishment." You know—and the thing that I noted that was deliberate and remarkable about her, not unlike Secretary Clinton, was that she made sure that young women knew they belonged at every single table having to do with national security, without exception.
Now, look, and we'll—and we're going—also going to help reduce costs and strengthen our economic and national security. It's no wonder the Chinese Communist Party is literally lobbying—paying lobbyists—against this bill passing. If I'd note parenthetically again: I have spent, according to international folks—I spent more time with Xi Jinping, leader of China, than any other world leader has—over 76 hours; 9 of them on a telephone, the rest in person—since I was Vice President and he was Vice President of China.
The Secretary of Defense can tell you—and those of you on—who work on national security issues know—the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA—the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. The people who set up before I came here—and that's been a long time ago—to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security—that's their only job. And it's a semiseparate agency; it's under the Defense Department. It's led to everything from the discovery of the internet to GPS and so much more that's enhanced our security.
Enlisted in the Navy—in the United States Navy at age 17 to fight in World War II. A few years later, enlisted in the Marine Corps to fight in Korea. Eventually named Secretary of the Navy by President Nixon, then elected to the United States Senate, where he became a towering and respected voice on foreign policy, national security, and defense; the second longest serving Senator from Virginia and the longest serving Republican.
This is not who we are. And I'll say one last thing—and you're going to—I've had a lot of experience internationally. And I mean that—not good or bad, just I have; I've chaired the Foreign Relations Committee. I've been deeply involved. I did national security for the—our last—the administration with Barack.
So I've been doing—I've been watching from that day on and been deeply involved either as a member of the Intelligence Committee or the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee or doing national security issues as Vice President and to today. And you're an incredible group of people—incredible group of people.
I know that you will continue to honor and uphold the highest traditions of the CIA and the highest values of this Nation for the next 75 years and beyond. You will continue to serve as the bedrock of our national security as well as our national strength.
When I return from the G-20 meetings in Indonesia with other world leaders, I'm going to invite the leaders of both political parties, as I've done in the past on my foreign trips, to the White House to discuss how we can work together for the remainder of this year and into the next Congress to advance the economic and national security priorities of the United States.
Sorry, I actually have an unrelated question too. Mr. President, do you think Elon Musk is a threat to U.S. national security? And should the U.S.—and with the tools you have—investigate his joint acquisition of Twitter with foreign governments, which include the Saudis?
Since I took office, we've added 100,000 public school teachers, and we're going to continue working to address the teacher shortage. It's critical. It's critical. [Applause] No, really. This is a national security issue.
Just a few months ago, after a long negotiation between myself and the new Speaker, we agreed to spending levels. The Government will fund essential domestic and national security priorities, while still—while still—cutting the deficit by $1 trillion over the next decade. Now, a small group of extreme Republicans don't want to live up to the deal. So now everyone in America could be forced to pay the price.
You know, just a few months ago after a long negotiation between myself and the Speaker of the House, we agreed to—on spending levels for the Government that—to fund essential domestic and national security priorities while still cutting more than $1 trillion over the next decade. We shook hands on it. We agreed.
I say this to Congress: We have to stand up to Putin. Send me a bipartisan national security bill. History is literally watching. History is watching. If the United States walks away, it will put Ukraine at risk. Europe is at risk. The free world will be at risk, emboldening others to do what they wish to do us harm.
You know, with a group of bipartisan Senators, led by a very conservative Senator from Oklahoma, we negotiated for weeks and agreed on the strongest national security, border security law in American history: 1,500 more border security agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve all these cases in 6 months instead of 6 years, because it takes 6 to 8 years now to resolve these cases—it's chaos; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines that significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles from smuggling fentanyl into America.
They will work with my foreign policy and national security team — because we can only beat this virus if we beat it everywhere.

For example, at the Defense Department—for those of you who cover the Defense area—there's something called the DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, set up exclusively within the Defense Department to seek out the cutting-edge research protects that enhance our national security. An outfit that came up with the internet, GPS, and a lot of stealth technology—a lot of things.
Today, I am pleased to announce nominations and staff for critical foreign policy and national security positions in my Administration.

Collectively, this team has secured some of the most defining national security and diplomatic achievements in recent memory — made possible through decades of experience working with our partners.

And my national security team will be coordinated by one of the youngest national security advisors in decades.

Jake understands my vision that economic security is national security.

They will not only repair, they will reimagine American foreign policy and national security for the next generation.

Last week, I announced nominations and staff for critical foreign policy and national security positions. A first-rate team that will keep us safe and secure.

A skilled leader and thinker on issues ranging from macroeconomics to consumer protection, and from national security to international affairs.

They will work with my foreign policy and national security team — because we can only beat this virus if we beat it everywhere.

Today, it is my great honor to add to my national security team a leader of extraordinary character, courage, experience, and accomplishment.

We need his firsthand knowledge of the immeasurable cost of war and the burden it places on our service members and their families to help bring to an end forever warsand ensure that the use of force is our tool of last resort to protect our national security, not our first.

She will work closely with my economic, national security, and foreign policy teams.

Together, they will align domestic policy, economic policy, and national security unlike ever before.

But we know this much — this attack constitutes a grave risk to our national security.

Now, Vice President-elect Harris and I, along with our nominees to lead our national security institutions, have just been briefed by some of the professionals who have been conducting agency reviews as part of our transition.

Rebuilding the full set of our instruments of foreign policy and national security is a key challenge that Vice President-elect Harris and I will face upon taking office — starting with our diplomacy.

As I said last week — this attack constitutes a grave risk to our national security.

Right now, we just aren't getting all the information that we need from the outgoing administration in key national security areas.

[The President signed a national security directive on United States global leadership to strengthen the international COVID-19 response and to advance global health security and biological preparedness.]
And I'm directing the Office of Management and Budget to review waivers to make sure they are only used in very limited circumstances. For example, when there's an overwhelming national security, humanitarian, or emergency need here in America. This hasn't happened before. It will happen now.
It also means replenishing our stockpiles to enhance our national security. As this pandemic has made clear, we can never again be in a position where we have to rely on a foreign country that doesn't share our interest in order to protect our people during a national emergency. We need to make our own protective equipment, essential products and supplies. And we'll work with our allies to make sure they have resilient supply chains as well.
Let me get to it. Today is "Climate Day" at the White House and—which means that today is "Jobs Day" at the White House. We're talking about American innovation, American products, American labor. And we're talking about the health of our families and cleaner water, cleaner air, and cleaner communities. We're talking about national security and America leading the world in a clean energy future.
Look, this Executive order I'm signing today also makes it official that climate change will be at the center of our national security and foreign policy.
And today's Executive order will help strengthen that commitment by working with other nations to support the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change and to increase our collective resilience. That includes a summit of world leaders that I'll convene to address this climate crisis on Earth Day, this year. In order to establish a new effort to integrate the security implications of climate change as part of our national security and risk assessment and analysis will also be included.
To summarize, this Executive order—it's about jobs—good-paying union jobs. It's about workers building our economy back better than before. It's a whole-of-Government approach to put climate change at the center of our domestic, national security, and foreign policy. It's advancing conservation; revitalizing communities and cities and in the—on the farmlands; and securing environmental justice.
We've elevated the status of cyber issues within our Government, including appointing the first national—Deputy National Security Adviser for Cyber and Emerging Technology. We're launching an urgent initiative to improve our capability, readiness, and resilience in cyberspace. Today I'm announcing additional steps to course-correct our foreign policy and better unite our democratic values with our diplomatic leadership. To begin, Defense Secretary Austin will be leading a Global Posture Review of our forces so that our military footprint is appropriately aligned with our foreign policy and national security priorities. It will be coordinated across all elements of our national security, with Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken working in close cooperation.
It's been a busy day. Earlier, I announced steps we've taken to impose costs on those responsible for the military coup in Burma. And I've just concluded a briefing with the civilian and military leadership where I laid out my national security priorities. And I want to share the message directly with the Department of Defense staff all around the world. Because each of you—each of you—whether you're newly enlisted, a career officer, a noncommissioned officer, or a civilian policy expert, you're essential to how we project our strength around the world, defend America's interests, and advance American leadership in the world.
There is no aspect of our agenda of the 21st-century leadership where the women and men of the Defense Department do not have a role: whether it's helping curb the pandemic here at home and around the world; or addressing the real threats of climate change that already is costing us billions in impacts on our bases, on our national security; or being part of an ongoing fight for racial justice. You are essential to how we must rethink and reprioritize our security to meet the challenges of this century, not the last. We need to take on the dangers and opportunities of emerging technologies, enhance our capabilities in cyberspace, ensure that we are positioned to lead in a new era of competition, from deep sea to outer space. And we need to meet the growing challenges posed by China to keep the peace and defend our interests in the Indo-Pacific and globally.
My first Presidential national security memorandum focused on surging health and humanitarian responses to defeat COVID-19 and to better prevent and prepare for the next pandemic. Today I'm announcing that the United States is making a $2 billion pledge to COVAX, with the promise of an additional $2 billion to urge others to step up as well.
The President. Good afternoon. The Vice President and I had a very productive meeting with a bipartisan group of Senators and House Members to address an issue of both concern for our economic security, as well as our national security: the resilience and reliability of our critical supply chains.
These are the White House offices that bring together the country's top scientists to address our most pressing needs, and they'll be part of the work to develop a DARPA-like advanced research effort on cancer and other diseases, just like we do DARPA in the Defense Department, which develops breakthrough projects to secure our national security.
And we have to take on sexual assault and harassment and violence against women in the military. Sexual assault is abhorrent and wrong at any time. And in our military, where so much of unit cohesion is built on trusting your fellow servicemembers to have your back, there's nothing less than a threat to our national security.
In fact, it's the largest American jobs investment since World War II. It will create millions of jobs, good-paying jobs. It will grow the economy, make us more competitive around the world, promote our national security interests, and put us in a position to win the global competition with China in the upcoming years.
I had a long discussion with Xi Jinping, the leader of China, when he called to congratulate me. We spent two hours on the phone. And he said—and I was astonished, my national security team and the China experts who were on the line—he said, "You've always said, Mr. President, that you can define America in one word: possibilities." That's who we are.
The Secretary of Defense can tell you—and those of you on—who work on national security issues know—the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA—the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. The people who set up before I came here—and that's been a long time ago—to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security—that's their only job. And it's a semiseparate agency; it's under the Defense Department. It's led to everything from the discovery of the internet to GPS and so much more that's enhanced our security.
The President. My national security staff and Defense staff has been in constant contact with their counterparts in the Middle East—not just with the Israelis, but also with everyone from the Egyptians, to the Saudis, to the Emiratis, et cetera.
And I want to thank, again, the Secretary Mayorkas for joining me today as well. He understands well how vital the Coast Guard is to our economic, our environmental, and national security, and how central you are to our Homeland Security mission.
The pandemic response would not necessarily have been considered a Coast Guard mission until there were more than 250,000 stranded cruise passengers who needed to be safely disembarked during COVID-19. Now we see, with harrowing clarity, how important halting this pandemic and improving our ability to prevent and respond to the next one is in our national security. That's why 500 Coast Guard reservists have deployed in support of FEMA and other nationwide vaccination efforts.
Whether it's interdicting illicit drug shipments at sea before they enter the United States or your stewardship of the environment, the Coast Guard has always recognized the broader definition of our national security. Alexander Hamilton may have been among the first to champion the principle that economic security is national security when he created the Revenue Cutter Service. But if it was true in 1790, it's gospel in 2021.
America is better positioned to advance our national security and our economic prosperity when we bring together like-minded nations to stand with us. These nations that have shed blood alongside of us in defense of our shared values. Our unrivaled network of alliances and partnerships that are the key to American advantage in the world and have been. They've made the world safer for all of us, and they are how we are going to meet the challenges of today, which are changing rapidly. We're going to meet it, though, from a position of strength.
We have to make sure that new technologies and norms of conduct in cyberspace are established, including addressing the growing threat of ransomware attacks, that are governed by our democratic values, not by the autocrats who are letting it happen. These are all critical national security issues in 2021, and we're going to be driving this agenda together with our G-7 partners.
Enlisted in the Navy—in the United States Navy at age 17 to fight in World War II. A few years later, enlisted in the Marine Corps to fight in Korea. Eventually named Secretary of the Navy by President Nixon, then elected to the United States Senate, where he became a towering and respected voice on foreign policy, national security, and defense; the second longest serving Senator from Virginia and the longest serving Republican.
The President. I can tell you a couple things: I received an update from our national security team this morning. It appears to have caused minimal damage to U.S. businesses, but we're still gathering information to the full extent of the attack. And I'm going to have more to say about this in the next several days. We're getting more detail and information. But that's what I can tell you now. And I feel good about our ability to be able to respond.
Earlier today I was briefed by our senior military and national security leaders on the status of the drawdown of U.S. forces and allied forces in Afghanistan.
This is not who we are. And I'll say one last thing—and you're going to—I've had a lot of experience internationally. And I mean that—not good or bad, just I have; I've chaired the Foreign Relations Committee. I've been deeply involved. I did national security for the—our last—the administration with Barack.
And you'd be amazed—as I traveled the world as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee or member of the Intelligence Committee for all those years, or as Vice President of the United States dealing with national security issues, or as President of the United States—how many of now my foreign counterparts thank you for what you do.
But I also know that your work is invaluable to our ability to make informed, strategic national security decisions. And I just had an interesting meeting, as you all know, with my very close friend, Vladimir Putin. [Laughter] I can tell the—one thing: I've been dealing with world leaders a long, long time. And just like all of you men and women, you can sort of sense somebody else after a while.
For example, at the Defense Department—for those of you who cover the Defense area—there's something called the DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, set up exclusively within the Defense Department to seek out the cutting-edge research protects that enhance our national security. An outfit that came up with the internet, GPS, and a lot of stealth technology—a lot of things.
My national security team and I have been closely monitoring the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and moving quickly to execute the plans we had put in place to respond to every constituency, including—and contingency—including the rapid collapse we're seeing now.
I cannot and I will not ask our troops to fight on endlessly in another country's civil war, taking casualties, suffering life-shattering injuries, leaving families broken by grief and loss. This is not in our national security interest. It is not what the American people want. It is not what our troops, who have sacrificed so much over the past two decades, deserve.
The President. Good afternoon. I've just met with the Vice President, Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, National Security Adviser Sullivan, and other members the national security leadership team in the Situation Room to discuss our ongoing efforts to evacuate American citizens, third-country civilians, Afghan allies, and vulnerable Afghans. And I want to provide the American people with a brief update and the—on the situation in Afghanistan.
The President. Good afternoon. After a series of meetings throughout the weekend with my national security team, I want to update the American people on our ongoing evacuation operation in Afghanistan.
The President. Well, thank you all for being here to discuss the core national security challenge we're facing, the American people are facing, and our economy is facing with cybersecurity. We've seen time and again how the technologies we rely on—from our cell phones to pipelines, to the electric grid—can become targets of hackers and criminals.
President Biden. Welcome, folks. It's a delight to have the Prime Minister here. I know there's going to be—we're going to talk about our relationship, which is as strong as can be. But I know you're going to want to know what's happened this morning in terms of my meetings with our—my national security team.
That assumption—that the Afghan Government would be able to hold on for a period of time beyond military drawdown—turned out not to be accurate. But I still instructed our national security team to prepare for every eventuality, even that one. And that's what we did.
As we turn the page on the foreign policy that has guided our Nation the last two decades, we've got to learn from our mistakes. To me, there are two that are paramount. First, we must set missions with clear, achievable goals, not ones we'll never reach. And second, we must stay clearly focused on the fundamental national security interest of the United States of America.
And so, folks, we've got to listen to the scientists and the economists and the national security experts. They all tell us this is code red; the Nation and the world are in peril. And that's not hyperbole. That is a fact. They've been warning us the extreme weather would get more extreme over the decade, and we're living it in real time now.
I just toured the Renewable Energy Lab, which I hadn't been here—not the same lab—but I hadn't been here since 2011. Which was started under President Carter and expanded under President Bush—H.W. Bush. Leaders of both parties have recognized that clean energy future and economic—is an economic imperative and a national security imperative and an environmental imperative.
One of the most important ways we can effectively enhance security and reduce violence is by seeking to improve the lives of the people all over the world who see that their governments are not serving their needs. Corruption fuels inequality, siphons off a nation's resources, spreads across borders, and generates human suffering. It is nothing less than a national security threat in the 21st century. Around the world, we're increasingly seeing citizens demonstrate their discontent seeing the wealthy and well connected grow richer and richer, taking payoffs and bribes, operating above the law while the vast majority of the people struggle to find a job or put food on the table or to get their businesses off the ground or simply send their children to school.
Q. Pandora Papers. The Pandora Papers. You had said that you put fight against corruption in the core of your national security policy. So what is your reaction? And do you plan to do anything about it?
I urge all of you—all of you—to consider bolstering your stockpiles critical to national security in your countries. But like so many challenges today, it isn't a problem any one of our nations can solve through unilateral actions. Coordination is the key, the reason for this meeting. The best way to reduce current delays and build in greater resilience for the future is to work together across the entire supply chain, from raw materials to warehousing and distribution.
And I want to thank the substantial bipartisan vote in the Senate for sending this bill to my desk today to avoid disruption of Government operations. And I want to urge Congress to use the time this bill provides to work toward a bipartisan agreement on a full-year funding bill that makes the needed investments in our economy and our people, from public health, to education, to national security.
The Defense Department has something called the Defense Advanced Research Agency—DARPA—that advances cutting-edge research to protect our national security and that's led to things like GPS and the modern Internet.
Let's get another historic piece of bipartisan legislation done. Let's do it for the sake of our economic competitiveness and our national security. And let's do it for the cities and towns all across America working to get their piece of the economic—global economic package. And let's do it for the dignity and pride of this country and the American worker.
Because, at the end of the day, this is about national security, economic security, and it's about jobs, good-paying, decent jobs you can raise a family on. Jobs. Jobs now. Jobs for the future. Jobs in every part of the country. Jobs that show—that bring the industrial Midwest back.
Q. I know. Do you mind—this morning you had—it seems like you spent a lot of time with your national security team at the White House. Are there any updates on Ukraine, Mr. President?
It's based on DARPA. Most everybody knows, in this town, what DARPA is. That's the Defense Department's Advanced Research Project Agency that has led to breakthrough technologies that protect our national security, from the internet to GPS and so much more.
We're also aided by the essential partnership of the Syrian Democratic Forces. I want to commend our dedicated intelligence community, the Department of Defense, and members of our national security team throughout the Government whose meticulous and tireless work over the course of many months ensured that this mission succeeded. This operation is testament to America's reach and capability to take out terrorist threats no matter where they try to hide anywhere in the world.
So we're creating a new "price preference." What this means is that if we're identifying some product that is so critical to our national security, health, or resilience, that we're going to create rules that allow us to pay a little more for them if they're made in America.
We should never be in that position again. And the bottom line is this bipartisan innovation bill will allow us to stamp more products "Made in America". And it's going to bolster our national security and our economic security. It matters, so let's get it done.
This innovation bill—ultimate bill that comes together is a key part of our futures. It's a key part of a Midwestern microelectronics corridor, if you will, that has everything to do with economic development and national security.
But there are three things we can deal with at the same time now: climate crisis, consumer costs, and national security. And they're not at odds with one another if we look at it the right way; they're compatible. That's why we have to pass the other provisions in my Better Back—Build Back America plan.
And I'd like to add a word about another investment this bill makes, one that I expect will pay dividends for hope, healing, and for our economy for generations to come. And it's called ARPA-H, Advanced Research Project Agencies of Health. This will be a new kind of entity, an engine for innovation, a place where we'll do high-risk, high-reward research that can drive unprecedented progress in biomedicine. It's based on DARPA, the Defense Department's Advanced Research Project Agency, that has led to breakthroughs in technologies that protect our national security, like the internet, GPS, and so much more.
Q. ——your own national security?
With the infrastructure law, we're going to keep building millions of good-paying jobs, and they're real jobs. And to build on progress, the Senate and House need to work on the innovation bill and send it to my desk. It's important for our economy and, I would argue, for our national security as well.
This—these steps will increase energy security, economic security, and national security. And we're going to stand up a joint task force to implement these changes and drive progress that will be cochaired by representatives from the White House and the President of the European Union's team—Commission's team.
Over the long term, as a matter of economic security and national security and for the survivability of the planet, we all need to move as quickly as possible to clean, renewable energy. And we'll work together to help get that done so that the days of any nation being subject to the whims of a tyrant for its energy needs are over. They must end. They must end. And second, we have to fight the corruption coming from the Kremlin to give the Russian people a fair chance. And finally, and most urgently, we maintain absolute unity—we must—among the world's democracies.
Security also means national and international security. This budget provides the resources we need to keep Americans safe, ensuring that our military remains the best prepared, best trained, best equipped military in the world.
And this will be among the largest investments in our national security in history. Some people don't like the increase, but we're in a different world today. America is more prosperous, more successful, and more just when it is more secure. We can restore fiscal responsibility and safeguard our security at home and abroad while meeting a third value, what I call "building a better America."
Yes, building a "made in America" clean energy future will help safeguard our national security. Yes, it will help us tackle climate change. Yes, it's going to help us ensure that America's creating millions of good-paying jobs for generations to come.
If I'd told those of you who are closer to my age in the audience—if we told your parents that we'd be here, they'd look at—like you were crazy. "What do you mean? We're the leader in the world." Not so. Congress needs to get this bill to my desk as quickly as possible. Our economic strength is on the line. And national security as well is on the line.
You know—and she mentored generations of rising foreign policy experts, the, quote, "foreign policy establishment." You know—and the thing that I noted that was deliberate and remarkable about her, not unlike Secretary Clinton, was that she made sure that young women knew they belonged at every single table having to do with national security, without exception.
The United States used to own the innovation field. In fact, it was a Department of [Defense]* research program that established DARPA. It was the first development of an antitank missile with advanced infrared guidance systems that culminated in today's Javelin. The bipartisan innovation act is going to help reverse decades-long decline in Federal research and development investment. And it should create [jobs]* and support entire families and expand U.S. manufacturing and strengthen our national security.
Where in God's name is it written that the United States can no longer be a leading manufacturer in the world? We've created, just in the last 17 months, 465,000 permanent manufacturing jobs in America. We have the best workers, the most competent employees, the best science in the world. And by funding the CHIPS Act, we're going to ensure the semiconductors that power the economy and our national security are made here in America again.
Fundamentally, there's a national—this is a national security issue. This is one of the reasons why the Chinese Communist Party is lobbying folks to oppose this bill. And it's an issue that unites Democrats and Republicans. So let's get it done. Let's get it done.
Now, look, and we'll—and we're going—also going to help reduce costs and strengthen our economic and national security. It's no wonder the Chinese Communist Party is literally lobbying—paying lobbyists—against this bill passing. If I'd note parenthetically again: I have spent, according to international folks—I spent more time with Xi Jinping, leader of China, than any other world leader has—over 76 hours; 9 of them on a telephone, the rest in person—since I was Vice President and he was Vice President of China.
And now, Putin's brutal and unprovoked war on Ukraine has further spotlighted the need to secure our critical supply chains so that our economy—our economic and our national security are not dependent on countries that don't share our values.
And to secure stability in the supply chain is very much and directly related to the lives of the people as well as the national economy. And this is, in turn, related to the national security as well as military security.
And we play a very important role, in terms of national security, for us, but for our region as well. I was a part of the government that brought the U.S. marines to Darwin——
Our Nation is grateful to all of you for your years of service and your continued service. And as we look to the years and the decades ahead, the Coast Guard is only going to play an increasingly prominent role in our homeland and our national security.
The President. No, no. The commitments from the Saudis don't relate to anything having to do with energy. It happens to be a larger meeting taking place in Saudi Arabia. That's the reason I'm going. And it has to do with national security for them, for Israelis. I have a program—anyway. It has to do with much larger issues than having to do with the energy piece.
The point is that we've said to them, "Here's the deal: We're going to allow you to have a profit on what you make, but not the exorbitant prices that you're charging for the oil now." We've delegated a commission—a group of our—[inaudible]—sherpa—our national security people to sit down and work out that mechanism. We think it can be done. We think it can be done, and it would drive down the price of oil, and it would drive down the price of gasoline as well.
So I've been doing—I've been watching from that day on and been deeply involved either as a member of the Intelligence Committee or the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee or doing national security issues as Vice President and to today. And you're an incredible group of people—incredible group of people.
I know that you will continue to honor and uphold the highest traditions of the CIA and the highest values of this Nation for the next 75 years and beyond. You will continue to serve as the bedrock of our national security as well as our national strength.
Mr. President, our relationship runs deep. It crosses party lines. It connects not only our governments, but also our peoples. This friendship is one of the cornerstones of Israel's national security. It is moving, and it is certainly not taken for granted. Throughout all your years in public service, you were one of the chief architects of this relationship. For that, you have the everlasting gratitude of the people of Zion.
Our national security is at stake as well. Extreme weather is already damaging our military installations here in the States. And our economy is at risk. So we have to act. Extreme weather disrupts supply chains, causing delays and shortages for consumers and businesses. Climate change is literally an existential threat to our Nation and to the world.
Director Deese. Great, thank you, Mr. President. And we are joined here by members of your economic and national security team, as well as business and labor leaders from across the country. We thought, sir, that we would try to divide this into two categories, the first being the national security implications and the second being the economic security and economic opportunity embedded in this legislation.
And—but we wanted to really try to zero in on both the urgency of acting and of Congress, as you say, acting without delay, hopefully, today and in the coming days, but also the opportunity: the opportunity for the country and for our national security as well.
So, sir, with your permission, we will start on the national security side and, kicking this off, go to Jim Taiclet, the CEO of Lockheed Martin. You've had the opportunity to visit their facility down in Alabama earlier this year.
And, Jim, I was hoping if you could just—for the President and all of us, just give us your sense of the broader national security concern here and also the ways in which semiconductors feed into the strength of our national security industrial base across the country.
Mr. Taiclet. We believe a robust, secure supply of microprocessors is essential both to national security and to the health of the defense industrial base in the aerospace industry as a whole.
National Security Adviser Jacob J. Sullivan. Thanks, Brian. And thanks to both Jim and Kath, who I think have really summed up the case very powerfully. So I'll be brief in expanding on why the CHIPS Act is so essential for both our national security and our strategic competitiveness.
So, when it comes down to it, there's bipartisan consensus, there's support from business, there's support from labor, there's support from the national security community across the board, and there is support from the American people to pass this legislation now and meet this moment and resolve these vulnerabilities.
Director Deese. Thank you, Mr. President. So we're going to pivot here from the national security case, which I think you've heard is both compelling and urgent to the economic security element of this.
Second, there is a national—as you heard, there's a national security imperative, as Deputy Defense Secretary Hicks and Jake Sullivan pointed out. Semiconductors also power our weapons systems.
We have a need to power our economy and national security for the decades to come. We make those decisions now. And the bill has requirements that when we use taxpayer dollars to fund research and development, the companies who get those funds have to deploy that technology that comes from that R&amp;D and the manufacturing of it right here in America. They get the money, they invest, they find a way, they find an answer. They have to invest in America, in a facility here in America.
Now, look, just yesterday I met with members of my economic and national security teams and CEOs and labor leaders to highlight the urgency of getting the bipartisan CHIPS Act to my desk. And today the Senate took a very important bipartisan step to get us closer. They, in fact, met the cloture requirement, and getting that bill to my desk is much closer now. Because this really matters.
Now, a third of the core inflation last year in America was due to the high price of automobiles, which was driven by the shortage of semiconductors. For the sake of our economy and jobs and costs and our national security, we have to make these semiconductors in America once again.
That will not only help us win the economic competition of the future, it's going to protect our national security as well.
We can channel all our resources. Most of all, we can channel the full talents of all our people into a greater measure of hope and opportunity for our Nation and for the world—to create good jobs, empower workers, grow the economy, not just for the wealthy, but grow it for everyone; to change the course of human health and disease; to tackle climate crisis with innovation and jobs; to lead the world—not—that's not hyperbole—lead the world in future industries and protect our national security.
Look, so many other Democrats and Republicans alike are committed to getting this bill done. And while the bipartisanship in Congress is critical, I also want to acknowledge something else. Look at the people here today. You come from all different backgrounds to support this bill. Governors—like the Governor of Illinois who I see—legislators, mayors, State legislators, entrepreneurs, businesspeople, labor. They're the reason why we're here. They're the reason why we got this far. Science—scientists, technologists, engineers, physicians, presidents of 4-year and community colleges—both—civil rights leaders, national security leaders, government officials.
There's an analysis that says investment in the CHIPS and Science Act will create 1 million—more than 1 million construction jobs alone over the next 6 years building semiconductor factories in America. America invented the semiconductor, as has been mentioned already, and this law brings it back home. It's in our economic interest and it's in our national security interest to do so.
Q. Are you concerned national security could have been compromised at Mar-a-Lago?
Q. Questions may be coming up on the national security front. Do you need to be briefed on it?
I also signed the CHIP and Science Act, a groundbreaking law. We'll once again manufacture semiconductor chips that power everyday—everything—our smartphones, dishwashers, automobiles, national security stuff—right here in America. Guess what? We invented it here. We invented it here in America.
Folks at home—at home, you might be wondering why is this such a big deal for manufacturing, something so small in size as a fingerprint, as a—you know, an—a semiconductor. Well, semiconductors are small computers that power everyday lives—smartphones, cars, washing machines, hospital equipment, the internet, electric grid, and so much more, including our national security.
Imagine if we had more of these kinds of factories across the country. This law makes that a reality. It matters. All of this is in our economic interest, and it's in our national security interest as well.
We're going to make sure that companies that take taxpayers' dollars don't turn around and make investments in China to undermine our supply chain and national security. You know, we have the power—we have the power—to take back any Federal funding if companies don't meet these requirements.
Let me close with this: This is about our economic security. It's about our national security. It's about good-paying, union jobs that you can raise a family on—as my dad would say—and have a little bit of breathing room. Jobs now. Jobs for the future. Jobs in every part of the country. We're not going to leave a part behind. There's no need to not develop the whole country. Jobs that show the industrial Midwest is back—the industrial Midwest is back.
And a critical way to do that is that going through what I call ARPA-H, Advanced Research Project Agencies for Health. It's based on DARPA, the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency, that has helped lead to breakthroughs in technologies to protect our national security, like the internet, GPS, and so much more.
My first day in office, I directed my national security and homeland security team to develop a first-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism. The goal was to improve and enhance our understanding of this growing threat within our country, prevent people from being mobilized to violence, to counter the relentless exploitation of the internet to recruit and mobilize domestic terrorism.
Pelley. No one has come to you to warn you that important national security secrets were revealed by the storage of those documents at the former president's home?

It's technology that is vital to our economy and equally important to our national security—our national security. And it's technology that's made possible because of semiconductors—those tiny little computer chips—everyone in this room knows better than in any other room in the country—the size of a fingertip, that power our everyday lives—everything in our lives: smartphones, cars, washing machines, hospital equipment, the internet, the electric grid, and so much more.
And many of these good-paying jobs don't require, as I said, a college degree. It matters. All of this is in our economic interest, and it's in our national security interest as well.
We're going to make sure the work—small and minority-owned businesses get to participate. We're going to make sure that companies that take these taxpayers' dollars do not turn around and make investments in China, investments that undermine our supply chains and national security. That's a guarantee. Because in this law, I have the power to take back any Federal funding from these companies if they don't meet these requirements. That's in the law.
This is about economic security, folks. It's about national security. And it's about good-paying jobs you can raise a family on. Jobs now. Jobs for the future. Jobs in every part of our country.
Refining and refilling the reserve at $70 a barrel is a good price for companies, and it's a good price for the taxpayers, and it's critical to our national security.
You can increase oil and gas production now while still moving full speed ahead to accelerate our transition to clean energy. That way—that way—we can lower energy costs for American families, enhance our national security at a very difficult moment.
These troops and their families are the backbone of our national security, as you know better than I, and caring for their needs for all those who serve is critical to maintaining the force we need to protect us now, but also our future. I know each of you continue to prioritize our people and their families as we meet the challenges ahead.
I've asked CEOs, including Micron and CEOs in many other countries, the following question—when I spoke to the Business Roundtable, spoke to the Chamber of Commerce—National Chamber of Commerce: When the United States Government decides to invest considerable resources in a new industry that we need to build up for our national security and economic well-being, does that encourage or discourage companies from getting in the game?
Our national security depends—depends—on us having access to the most modern computer chips in the world. It depends on it. One of the things I've been able to do, and I make no bones about it, because of—with Russia's activities, we have curtailed their ability to access some of this stuff. And guess what? They're not able to rebuild those devastating weapon systems to take out those civilians in Ukraine as well. Not a joke. It makes a big difference. These things matter. They matter a great deal.
Folks, the reason we're here today is because of another law that I signed with Mike's help. And it matters for our economy and national security of our veterans. It's called the CHIPS and Science Act. It's a groundbreaking law that's going to build the future here in America. Here in America.
And here's another thing: This is also a national security issue—a national security issue. Earlier this year, I went down to a Lockheed factory in Alabama, where they make Javelin missiles. Guess what? We were having trouble—we were having trouble supplying the Javelin missiles to Ukraine because they didn't have the chips. They didn't have the computer chips. To help defend themselves against Putin's brutal and unprovoked war, we were sending these guys these Javelins.
When I return from the G-20 meetings in Indonesia with other world leaders, I'm going to invite the leaders of both political parties, as I've done in the past on my foreign trips, to the White House to discuss how we can work together for the remainder of this year and into the next Congress to advance the economic and national security priorities of the United States.
Sorry, I actually have an unrelated question too. Mr. President, do you think Elon Musk is a threat to U.S. national security? And should the U.S.—and with the tools you have—investigate his joint acquisition of Twitter with foreign governments, which include the Saudis?
The climate crisis is about human security, economic security, environmental security, national security, and the very life of the planet. So today I'd like to share with you how the United States is meeting the climate crisis with urgency and with determination to ensure a cleaner, safer, and healthier planet for all of us.
I will also sign into law the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes authorities for—to make it easier for the Department of Defense to procure critical munitions and defense materials for Ukraine and other key materials to strengthen our national security.
It's about revitalizing American manufacturing. It's about America once again being the leading edge of technological innovation. It's about America's national security.
And, together, I think we're achieving some really significant things. Today we're going to discuss how we can try to help stabilize Haiti and how we can deal with migration and, at the same time, bolster our national security.
Each of us here today—generations of national security leaders, decades of eager and brilliant students, the entire Armed Forces of the United States of America—we all will forever bear the imprint of Ash Carter, thank God.
We're modernizing our military alliance, building on Japan's historic increase in defense spending and new national security strategy.
And Japan and the United States are currently facing the most challenging and complex security environment in recent history. And in order to ensure our peace and prosperity in the region and to contribute to that and also safeguard peace and security of Japan, in late last year, Japan formulated a new national security strategy.
Mayor Jones. Great. Great. Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS and Science Act, we're seeing jobs return to our cities, and we're preparing our citizens for the many opportunities to come. What can we as mayors do to help you further your agenda of shoring up our national security and bring more high-quality jobs to America's cities?
Q. You were saying the recommendation from your—was from your national security——
Folks, we haven't even talked about my budget for our national security or our intelligence and foreign policy communities. My budget makes robust investments in our military and defense.
And, Madam President, the steps the U.S. and the EU are taking over the last few years has increased energy security, it's—our economic security, and, I would argue, our national security.
The AUKUS agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australia's defense capability in all of our history, strengthening Australia's national security and stability in our region; building a future made in Australia with record investments in skills, jobs, and infrastructure; and delivering a superior defense capability into the future.
And when we talk about national security, we have shared your language about climate change being a national security issue as well, which is, of course, the entry ticket into credibility in the Pacific, in particular. And we have spent our first year in office really rebuilding relationships in the region based upon our action on climate change.

It's about public health, our economic futures, our national security.
Before I speak of the progress of this trip, I was informed by my national security team, on the way over here, that—about an attack in Syria yesterday. An Iranian-backed militant group used an unmanned aerial vehicle to strike one of our facilities, causing several American casualties. One of our citizens tragically died in that attack.
And, on the flight up yesterday, I spoke with our national security team and ordered an immediate response. Last night U.S. military forces carried out a series of airstrikes in Syria targeting those responsible for attacking our personnel.
And today we're going to discuss the opportunities and the risks of artificial intelligence. AI can help deal with some very difficult challenges like disease and climate change, but we also have to address the potential risks to our society, to our economy, to our national security.
