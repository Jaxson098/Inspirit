Some of the major commercial companies in our Nation who want to prevent any eavesdropping on their transactions, commercial transactions, not involving national security, also make an attempt to prevent intercepts by those who listen in on the free air waves.
The second question that arose was, if we have to go to trial because of an indictment, should it be concluded aggressively or would the question of national security revelations have to be faced? And we postponed that decision with the understanding that if that prospect did present itself to me, that I would then be briefed on the consequences of those prospects. That never did occur.
The question that was raised in September was based on a statement by Admiral Turner, who heads up the CIA, the national intelligence community, that we were faced with a prospect of two alternatives: One was a decision not to prosecute at all, and the other alternative that Admiral Turner mentioned, which was in the reporter's question, that the complete trial would be held with the revelation of national security secrets. I replied that the Attorney General had never presented that information to me, which was true.
He made that statement publicly. We monitored it very quickly. It was transmitted to me in the White House. The Secretary of State was there; the Secretary of Defense was there; the national security adviser was there; the Vice President was there; Jody [Powell] was there. We'd been there since 4 o'clock in the morning. And when that message got to me confirming that point, I went before the American people and said we believe we have finally arrived at the point where the hostages will be coming home.
We believe that there ought to be an end to the hostilities between Iran and Iraq and an immediate commencement of negotiations to settle the disputed boundaries between them. This reflects the long-standing policy of our country that all territorial disputes should be settled peacefully and not by aggression. The United States remains committed to the proposition that the national security and integrity of Iran is in the interest of national stability.
There obviously will be differences of opinion. I would hope that these differences could be ironed out among the State Department, the national security adviser, the present Director of the CIA, the director of the intelligence community, Stun Turner, and the Secretary of Defense.
In worldwide disarmament, nonproliferation, our SALT negotiations with the Soviet Union, an end to the testing of atomic weapons, in many other areas of international diplomacy involving our national security, we are moving without timidity, openly, which does quite often create controversy. These challenges are not easy, but the prospect of success is exciting to me. And I know that all of you share the ultimate goals. And I need your active, constant help in your own community, because you are all leaders in supporting these difficult challenges that I have accepted with pleasure. This is important.
Have you reached any conclusion in your own mind on this matter? And is the issue of revealing national security material sufficiently resolved now so that the judgment can be made on the merits of a possible indictment itself?
One of the additional problems with the lack of conservation is that we've now increased our oil exports [imports] to $45 billion a year, and they comprise about 50 percent of all the oil we use. If we should have—and heaven knows, I hope we never have—another oil embargo where those supply interruptions would afflict our Nation, it would be a much more serious problem to our national security, to our own economic prosperity, and, even, national existence than it was back in 1973, when that temporary interruption took place.
The most immediate and urgent foreign policy decision to be made by the current legislative session is in lifting the arms embargo against Turkey. The points that the Congress intended to underscore 3 years ago, when the embargo was imposed, have all been made, but now the embargo is not contributing to a settlement of the Cyprus dispute, nor is it helping to improve our relationship with our allies, Turkey and Greece. It's driven a wedge between those two countries and has weakened the cohesiveness and the readiness of NATO. It's thereby harmed our own national security interests in the eastern Mediterranean, an area which is crucial to the defense of the southern flank of Europe, and also our own access and that of others to the Middle East.
And 2 years ago I promised to maintain our national security and to keep our Nation strong, and we've done that. The defense establishment has never, never been so strong. But we've done more than guarantee our basic security with military strength; we've cut wasteful military expenditures.
The thing that does concern inc, however, is the tendency among our people to alienate themselves, one from another: the evolution of special interest groups, with a narrowly focused grasping for advantage; the inability that our country has so far exhibited to deal with a major threat to our national security, that is, an overdependence on foreign oil; and a general lack of confidence in the future as revealed by public opinion polls and an absence of saving habits. And I described this as best I could in the speech in July on Sunday evening, after coming back from Camp David.
The League of Women Voters is pleased to welcome to the Cleveland, Ohio, Convention Center Music Hall President Jimmy Carter, the Democratic Party's candidate for reelection to the Presidency, and Governor Ronald Reagan of California, the Republican Party's candidate for the Presidency. The candidates will debate questions on domestic, economic, foreign policy, and national security issues.
Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest that I have. It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority. Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with 7 abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States-besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal. And we're not equal in this treaty for one reason alone: Our B-52 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.

Whether or not to proceed with the case will be the exclusive right of the Justice Department. The revelation of any documents that affect our national security will be my own judgment, in this or other cases.
On the other hand, we must protect the rights of citizens. Under this bill, the citizens' rights will be protected. A warrant will have to be obtained from a judge and there will have to be a showing that it is needed and then if the showing is proper, it will be granted. I join in this bill because I think it is necessary to protect our national security and that it will protect the rights of American citizens.
As chairman of the subcommittee that dealt unsuccessfully with this piece of legislation or legislation in this field last year, I'm certainly impressed with the difficulty confronting us. It's a vexatious question, because those most interested have very different perspectives--the intelligence community, those interested in national security on one side, and those especially sensitive to civil liberties, privacy on the other. It's almost impossible to reconcile these different perspectives. And yet, as the President has said, in the national interest it is important that we have this legislation and that the judiciary, the executive branch, and the Congress all be mutually involved.
This has been done and is being done and will be done strictly on the basis of national security requirements, when there is a very close call to be made.
Some of the major commercial companies in our Nation who want to prevent any eavesdropping on their transactions, commercial transactions, not involving national security, also make an attempt to prevent intercepts by those who listen in on the free air waves.
Negotiations for a comprehensive ban on nuclear explosions are now being conducted by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. As in other areas where vital national security interests are engaged, agreements must be verifiable and fair. They must be seen by all the parties as serving a longer term interest that justifies the restraints of the moment.
In worldwide disarmament, nonproliferation, our SALT negotiations with the Soviet Union, an end to the testing of atomic weapons, in many other areas of international diplomacy involving our national security, we are moving without timidity, openly, which does quite often create controversy.

It's not an easy thing to bring about a comprehensive peace settlement. Immediate expectations have sometimes been exaggerated. The definition of real peace--I think we've made good progress on that already. The resolution of the Palestinian question still has not been decided. And the solution to the problem concerning borders and national security has also not been decided.
We have very little disharmony among our heads of departments in other controversial areas. The Joint Chiefs of Staff meet with me frequently, along with the national security adviser and the Secretary of Defense, to talk about SALT questions, and the Secretary of State is present.
When we deal with the Soviets on SALT or a comprehensive test ban, or when we deal with the Middle East question, I don't have to worry about contentiousness or jealousy or lack of communication or an incompatibility between the national security adviser, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Treasury, and others.
We are hard at work with Great Britain and the Soviet Union on an agreement which will stop testing and will protect our national security and provide for adequate verification of compliance. We are now making, I believe, good progress toward this comprehensive ban on nuclear explosions.
Throughout the negotiations, we were determined that our national security interests would be protected; that the canal would always be open and neutral and available to ships of all nations; that in time of need or emergency our warships would have the right to go to the head of the line for priority passage through the canal; and that our military forces would have the permanent right to defend the canal if it should ever be in danger. The new treaties meet all of these requirements.
This morning I would like to talk to you about our national security—where we now stand, what new circumstances we face, and what we are going to do in the future.
Of course, our national security rests on more than just military power. It depends partly on the productive capacity of our factories and our farms, on an adequate supply of natural resources with which God has blessed us, on an economic system which values human freedom above centralized control, on the creative ideas of our best minds, on the hard work, cohesion, moral strength, and determination of the American people, and on the friendship of our neighbors to the north and south.
But adequate and capable military forces are still an essential element of our national security. We, like our ancestors, have the obligation to maintain strength equal to the challenges of the world in which we live, and we Americans will continue to do so.
Let us review briefly how national security issues have changed over the past decade or two.
As President and as Commander in Chief, I am responsible, along with the Congress, for modernizing, expanding, and improving our Armed Forces whenever our security requires it. We've recently completed a major reassessment of our national defense strategy. And out of this process have come some overall principles designed to preserve our national security during the years ahead.
Arms control agreements are a major goal as instruments of our national security, but this will be possible only if we maintain appropriate military force levels. Reaching balanced, verifiable agreements with our adversaries can limit the cost of security and reduce the risk of war. But even then, we must—and we will—proceed efficiently with whatever arms programs our own security requires.
All executive branch agencies will avoid or reduce the purchase of goods or services whose prices are rapidly rising, unless by so doing we would seriously jeopardize our national security or create serious unemployment. I'm also asking that all new or renegotiated Federal contracts which contain price escalation clauses should reflect the principle of deceleration.
The most immediate and urgent foreign policy decision to be made by the current legislative session is in lifting the arms embargo against Turkey. The points that the Congress intended to underscore 3 years ago, when the embargo was imposed, have all been made, but now the embargo is not contributing to a settlement of the Cyprus dispute, nor is it helping to improve our relationship with our allies, Turkey and Greece. It's driven a wedge between those two countries and has weakened the cohesiveness and the readiness of NATO. It's thereby harmed our own national security interests in the eastern Mediterranean, an area which is crucial to the defense of the southern flank of Europe, and also our own access and that of others to the Middle East.

We are hard at work with Great Britain and the Soviet Union on an agreement which will stop testing and will protect our national security and provide for adequate verification of compliance. We are now making, I believe, good progress toward this comprehensive ban on nuclear explosions.
The Taft-Hartley law gives me the authority to bring the Federal Government into the discussions only if the national security is threatened, and that point has not yet been reached. We monitor on a daily basis the reserve supplies of coal, both geographically and industry by industry.
He's interested in our national security. He's been especially singled out for honor by serving on the Senate committee on intelligence and I don't think there's any more sensitive area in the whole Federal Government than the special committee on the intelligence community in the U.S. Senate. That's a small group of carefully chosen leaders who are extremely trustworthy, because in their hands and in their minds are placed the utmost sensitive secrets about our interrelationship with foreign governments. And they are also trusted, along with the President, the CIA, and the Defense Department, in protecting our country against subversion. And there has to be a careful balancing there between strength in protecting our country and the protection of the basic rights of American people. We've seen during the Nixon years that this can be abused.
One of the additional problems with the lack of conservation is that we've now increased our oil exports [imports] to $45 billion a year, and they comprise about 50 percent of all the oil we use. If we should have—and heaven knows, I hope we never have—another oil embargo where those supply interruptions would afflict our Nation, it would be a much more serious problem to our national security, to our own economic prosperity, and, even, national existence than it was back in 1973, when that temporary interruption took place.
The National Security Council will make a report to me early this week recommending from the State Department, from the Defense Department, from the national security adviser, what weapons to recommend to the Congress. After that point, the Congress will have a 30-day plus a 21-day period to respond affirmatively or not. I will decide later on this week what to recommend to the Congress.
If you start writing the exemptions and the caveats to a balanced budget requirement in the Constitution, this particular amendment would of necessity be longer than all the Bill of Rights put together. And you would have to say that if an emergency existed under certain circumstances, on extremely high unemployment, or if the thirties depression times came back, or if our national security was endangered, and so forth, that you'd have to make an exception.
Whether or not to proceed with the case will be the exclusive right of the Justice Department. The revelation of any documents that affect our national security will be my own judgment, in this or other cases.
On the other hand, we must protect the rights of citizens. Under this bill, the citizens' rights will be protected.

This is, Mr. President, the reason why we yearn for peace, pray for peace, and shall do everything humanly possible and make all the possible endeavors to bring about real peace between us and our neighbors. Peace is inseparable from national security.
May I assure you, Mr. President, that to us that concept is no excuse for anything; neither is it a cloak of anything. To us, with the experience of physical annihilation and spiritual redemption, national security may mean the lives of every man, woman, and child in Israel. The lives can be, under certain circumstances, directly threatened and put in jeopardy.
This is some phenomenon, because they know we have a great friend, the United States of America. And we, Israel, are a faithful ally of the United States. We do whatever we can to serve the free world. We contribute to the national security-as tonight I will show you, Mr. President-to the national security of the United States.
We are proud that we are a democracy, as the United States carries the banner of democracy. This is our contribution to freedom, national security of the free world. We shall continue to do so to the best of our ability.
Our national security was often defined almost exclusively in terms of military competition with the Soviet Union. This competition is still critical, because it does involve issues which could lead to war. But however important this relationship of military balance, it cannot be our sole preoccupation to the exclusion of other world issues which also concern us both.
The other part of the question is about its need. I have only mentioned the oil and natural gas transportation, but as you know, our major warships, large tankers and cargo ships cannot presently use the Panama Canal at all. And I would guess that before the year 2000 comes and the existing treaty with Panama and our control of the Panama Canal might expire, that the need for this larger, wider, deeper canal without the multiple locks might be in the interest of our national security, militarily as well as economically.
About 5 months ago, in April, I spoke with the American people and with the Congress about one of the most pressing national needs--to develop a comprehensive energy policy. The reason that we have to act is not because we have crises or emergencies at this present time, but because they are imminent, and we need to begin preparing now to protect our own economic and our national security wellbeing for the future.
Negotiations for a comprehensive ban on nuclear explosions are now being conducted by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. As in other areas where vital national security interests are engaged, agreements must be verifiable and fair. They must be seen by all the parties as serving a longer term interest that justifies the restraints of the moment.

And I need your active, constant help in your own community, because you are all leaders in supporting these difficult challenges that I have accepted with pleasure. This is important.
Obviously, when I reach a point of thinking that the national security might be endangered, that either the ore stocks or the steel stocks are being reduced too much, then I would not hesitate to get involved. But as is the case in the longshoremen's strike, as has been the case in the past with coal and other very important industries, my inclination is not to get involved in those. And I might say that Ray Marshall, the Secretary of Labor, shares my belief very deeply.
Have you reached any conclusion in your own mind on this matter? And is the issue of revealing national security material sufficiently resolved now so that the judgment can be made on the merits of a possible indictment itself?
If this trend continues, the excessive reliance on foreign oil could make the very security of our Nation increasingly dependent on uncertain energy supplies. Our national security depends on more than just our Armed Forces; it also rests on the strength of our economy, on our national will, and on the ability of the United States to carry out our foreign policy as a free and independent nation. America overseas is only as strong as America at home.
The second question that arose was, if we have to go to trial because of an indictment, should it be concluded aggressively or would the question of national security revelations have to be faced? And we postponed that decision with the understanding that if that prospect did present itself to me, that I would then be briefed on the consequences of those prospects. That never did occur.

Dr. Brzezinski, my national security adviser, and my wife, Rosalynn, had a visit with Cardinal Wyszynski this morning and did this .as an expression of our appreciation for the degree of freedom to worship in this country.
When we deal with the Soviets on SALT or a comprehensive test ban, or when we deal with the Middle East question, I don't have to worry about contentiousness or jealousy or lack of communication or an incompatibility between the national security adviser, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Treasury, and others.

Today I made a speech in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Wake Forest University, about national security and then came out this afternoon, flew from Savannah by helicopter to land on the greatest warship in the world, a brand new atomic-powered aircraft carrier, 95,000 tons, the U.S.S. Eisenhower, operating off your coast. And I saw there a superb crew, young crew—the average age, 19 1/2 years old.
This morning I would like to talk to you about our national security—where we now stand, what new circumstances we face, and what we are going to do in the future.
Of course, our national security rests on more than just military power. It depends partly on the productive capacity of our factories and our farms, on an adequate supply of natural resources with which God has blessed us, on an economic system which values human freedom above centralized control, on the creative ideas of our best minds, on the hard work, cohesion, moral strength, and determination of the American people, and on the friendship of our neighbors to the north and south.
But adequate and capable military forces are still an essential element of our national security. We, like our ancestors, have the obligation to maintain strength equal to the challenges of the world in which we live, and we Americans will continue to do so.
Let us review briefly how national security issues have changed over the past decade or two.

I'm also asking that all new or renegotiated Federal contracts which contain price escalation clauses should reflect the principle of deceleration.
One of the additional problems with the lack of conservation is that we've now increased our oil exports [imports] to $45 billion a year, and they comprise about 50 percent of all the oil we use. If we should have—and heaven knows, I hope we never have—another oil embargo where those supply interruptions would afflict our Nation, it would be a much more serious problem to our national security, to our own economic prosperity, and, even, national existence than it was back in 1973, when that temporary interruption took place.
In a way, I believe that our Nation is being tested these days. We have a period of relative calm, free from great crisis or threat to our national security, and we are being tested to see whether or not we can take advantage of this opportunity for improvement.
The most immediate and urgent foreign policy decision to be made by the current legislative session is in lifting the arms embargo against Turkey. The points that the Congress intended to underscore 3 years ago, when the embargo was imposed, have all been made, but now the embargo is not contributing to a settlement of the Cyprus dispute, nor is it helping to improve our relationship with our allies, Turkey and Greece. It's driven a wedge between those two countries and has weakened the cohesiveness and the readiness of NATO. It's thereby harmed our own national security interests in the eastern Mediterranean, an area which is crucial to the defense of the southern flank of Europe, and also our own access and that of others to the Middle East.
Senator John Stennis has worked long and hard as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee to promote our national security. It's very fitting that this new guided missile cruiser be named for the home State of a man who has done so much to keep our Nation safe and strong.
Oil imports in dollars are almost twice as great as all agricultural exports. This hurts our dollars. It costs Americans jobs. It robs us with unnecessary inflation and leaves our economy and even our national security at the mercy of a foreign cartel.
And 2 years ago I promised to maintain our national security and to keep our Nation strong, and we've done that. The defense establishment has never, never been so strong. But we've done more than guarantee our basic security with military strength; we've cut wasteful military expenditures.
Weather satellites have already saved billions of dollars, thousands of lives through early warnings of hurricanes and floods. We will continue to develop them. We've greatly strengthened our national security through defense space applications. We will continue to develop these capabilities.
Enacting these five bills, as everyone here knows, has been a difficult and sometimes a painful political process. It's required confidence, dedication, vision, and hard work. But I know of no task which we faced at the outset of my own administration which was more important to the economic health and well-being and, indeed, even the national security of our country.
The openness of Government is also very crucial. It's good for consumers of all kinds to know what their own Government is doing. There can be no secrecy surrounding how the Federal funds are spent, except when the extreme urgency of national security is involved.
Ms. WALTERS. Mr. President, you said that, when you campaigned, that you would never tell a lie. Well, have you ever told a lie since then, even a tiny white lie, even for national security?
But our national security in this complicated age requires more than just military might. In less than a lifetime, world population has more than doubled, colonial empires have disappeared, and a hundred new nations have been born. Mass communications, literacy, and migration to the world's cities have all awakened new yearnings for economic justice and human rights among people everywhere.
Another thing that I would like to point out is that there would be a necessity for the careful drafting in such a constitutional amendment for exceptions. We would, obviously, have to deal with very serious economic circumstances if they did prevail, extremely high unemployment rate, or an extremely deep depression. In addition to that, we would have to meet the needs for national security if our Nation was threatened.
Mr. President, you are not unaware, I'm sure, of the differences of opinion in our country in the sphere of foreign policy and national security. Two sentiments, however, are shared by all sections of our people: a sincere and ardent desire for true peace, and the profound conviction that in order to achieve that peace, Israel has made enormous sacrifices above and beyond what might have been expected or demanded of her.
If you start writing the exemptions and the caveats to a balanced budget requirement in the Constitution, this particular amendment would of necessity be longer than all the Bill of Rights put together. And you would have to say that if an emergency existed under certain circumstances, on extremely high unemployment, or if the thirties depression times came back, or if our national security was endangered, and so forth, that you'd have to make an exception.
As the Congress and the American people consider the SALT treaty, which is now nearly complete, the debate will center around four basic questions: Why do we need SALT? How is the treaty related to our overall defense strategy? Can Soviet compliance be verified? How does the treaty relate to Soviet activities which challenge us and challenge our interests? Let me address each question in turn. First, why do we need a strategic arms limitation treaty? We need it because it will contribute to a more peaceful world-and to our own national security.
But our independent verification capabilities are not limited only to observing these large-scale activities. We can determine not only how many systems there are, but what they can do. Our photographic satellites and other systems enable us to follow technological developments in Soviet strategic forces with great accuracy. There is no question that any cheating which might affect our national security would be discovered in time for us to respond fully.
Again, SALT II is not a favor we are doing for the Soviet Union; it's an agreement carefully negotiated in the national security interests of the United States of America.
As onerous as they might be on occasion, we have tried to minimize paperwork; we've minimized the intrusion of government into your own affairs. And I believe that almost all of you would agree they are much superior to mandatory wage and price controls, which I never intend to impose in this country short of a threat to our own national security. I hope you support me in that position.
The last point I want to make to this group, who are so interested and so competent and who'll play such a major role in the future, is that the Export Administration Act will be renewed this year. There's been a great deal of controversy about this act. What we want to have is sure and prompt export licensing combined with an adequate reserve authority for the President to protect our national security. And the balancing of these two items is one that I feel sure can be better assured because of the new Export Council that's being established this morning.
We will seek new areas where more cooperation might be forthcoming and also less competition. The arms limitation treaty which President Brezhnev and I will sign next Monday embodies that spirit, and it gives us enhanced national security and an increased hope for a peaceful future.
The SALT II treaty must be judged on its own merits. And on its own merits, it is a substantial gain for national security for us and the people whom we represent, and it's a gain for international stability. But it would be the height of irresponsibility to ignore other possible consequences of a failure to ratify this treaty.
In the vortex of these changes, many Asian nations are striving harder for their national security and economic development by fortifying their spirits of self-reliance.
Without a vigorous economic system, we cannot assure the adequacy of our national security. We cannot provide sufficiently for the poor and the aged and the infirm and the veterans who have served this country. We cannot revitalize our cities. We cannot guarantee proper shelter or education or medical care for all Americans. We will be handicapped in maintaining American leadership in a fragile world.
This is the first time in history that I know about when our country has been faced with discomfort or inconvenience or more tangible and far-reaching adverse impacts on human life, without having at the same time a threat to our Nation that was cohesive in its implications. Obviously during the First World War, the Second World War, our country was bound together because we were threatened militarily. During the Great Depression, when people were inconvenienced with massive unemployment and so forth, we were bound together with an economic threat to our country. Now we don't have that tangible, identifiable threat. The threat to our national security that does actually exist from a shortage of oil supplies and an increasing and excessive dependence on foreign oil is hard for the American people to see or to quantify or to accept.
In the past, in the history of our country, when we've had a serious challenge like this, it's been easy for us to see it and to recognize it, like in the First World War, the Second World War, or even the Great Depression. But with this energy threat to our basic national security, caused by our excessive dependence on foreign oil, it's hard for the average American to see it or to understand it.
This, then, is a report on what the dividends of these research and development investments are likely to be. I believe you will see that domestic sources of energy can become available in the years ahead that will help reduce our energy dependence on foreign imports, will strengthen our economy, and will improve our national security.
But there are three things that a President always has in mind, you know—national security, always present; the Congress, always present; President George Meany, that's the third one. [Laughter]
The thing that does concern inc, however, is the tendency among our people to alienate themselves, one from another: the evolution of special interest groups, with a narrowly focused grasping for advantage; the inability that our country has so far exhibited to deal with a major threat to our national security, that is, an overdependence on foreign oil; and a general lack of confidence in the future as revealed by public opinion polls and an absence of saving habits. And I described this as best I could in the speech in July on Sunday evening, after coming back from Camp David.
We can be proud, too, of the great struggle for SALT II, which will control nuclear weapons, it will enhance our Nation's security, it will contribute to world peace. It took 7 years to negotiate it. This is a goal: nuclear weapons control, strong national security, world peace. It's obviously in the tradition of the Democratic Party.
When it became imperative to act with our national security at stake, he led the House to enact without delay the most farreaching energy program our country has ever seen. Victory is now in sight for both Houses of the Congress if we work together. That's Tip O'Neill, Democratic Party government, and I'm proud to be a part of it.
We all hope and work and pray that we will see a world in which the weapons of war are no longer necessary, but now we must deal with the hard facts, with the world as it is. In the dangerous and uncertain world of today, the keystone of our national security is still military strength, strength that is clearly recognized by Americans, by our allies, and by any potential adversary.
There are several reasons why SALT II will strengthen the military aspect of our national security:
We're bound together with a common belief that our national security is intertwined with yours. When we deal with important issues of the present and future years, like energy, our consultations are very close. We are bound together through trade and through culture, through tourism and through blood kin. Perhaps the most important things, however, which bind us together are a common belief in freedom and democracy, the right of people to speak their own minds without interference, and the belief in equal justice for all.
Along with other countries, we will provide military equipment, food, and other assistance to help Pakistan defend its independence and its national security against the seriously increased threat it now faces from the north. The United States also stands ready to help other nations in the region in similar ways.
It's difficult to understand why the Soviets took this action. I think they probably underestimated the adverse reaction from around the world. I've talked to many other leaders, our allies and those representing nations that might be further threatened, and they all believe that we took the right action. It was not done for political reasons; it was not done to implement some foreign policy. It was done in the interest of our national security.
Our national security, the quality of our lives, national unity, common understanding, fairness and equity depend upon the rapid completion of this energy policy without further delay in the Congress. And then we'll have an energy program that will help us to cut down waste, produce American coal, crude oil, natural gas, synthetics, will help us to shift to solar and other replenishable forms of energy, and will also help us at the same time to protect the quality of our environment.
It's been 3 1/2 years now since I outlined to you my national security goals at your national convention. I'm proud of the success we've had in fulfilling those plans that you and I shared on that day.
Within our own country, opposing voices have been raised against these necessary actions—against the grain embargo, against the Olympic boycott, against registration for the draft, against full funding of the defense budget which I've proposed to the Congress. In this developing debate concerning our national security, I need the support of freedom-loving Americans everywhere, and I am sure that I can count on my fellow Legionnaires for your support.
Last month I said in my State of the Union address that we must face the world as it is. We must be honest with ourselves, and we must be honest with others. That's why, 3 years ago, I determined to reverse the declining effectiveness of the military forces. And that's why I've worked so hard to fight inflation as we develop a national energy policy. We are dangerously dependent on imported oil, and them is no cheap way out. Let me quote from the American Legion's own energy policy statement: "Our national security, as well as our economic security, cannot exist without energy independence"
My proposal to the Congress is designed to reduce this use of oil and natural gas equivalent by 1 million barrels per day by 1990. It will provide significant economic and national security benefits and represents a sound investment in our Nation's energy security.
Even more importantly, inflation is a threat to our national security. Unless controlled, it will sap our strength, our world leadership, our national unity, and with it, eventually American ideals.
Our overriding concern, above everything else, must be our national security-our military security, our energy security, and our economic security. There is no more powerful force for peace than the United States of America—a beacon for freedom and for human rights, committed to world peace for all, and strong militarily. And our military power today is second to none on Earth, and as long as I am President and share this commitment of the American people, the United States will stay this way.
In the last 3 years, working with you, I've been determined to strengthen those programs and put workers back on the job, and we've done that together. I am just as determined with your help—with some sacrifice required on a transient basis and with some temporary disappointments, yes—to control inflation in this country. I'm determined that we sustain the America that has international security, energy security, and economic security so vital in the 1980's.
When I proposed this tax I indicated that the revenues should be used for three basic purposes: one, to assist low-income households in bearing the burden of rapidly increasing energy costs; secondly, to improve the transit systems of our country, including not only rail but also buses and subways, and even the sharing of rides in other rubber-tired vehicles; and third, the development of alternative supplies of energy. We have placed a special emphasis on conservation. We must not lose sight of these three basic goals if we are to overcome inflation and the risks to our national security caused by our overdependence on foreign oil, which is now comprising almost half the total oil that we use. We must mount a massive effort to develop American energy resources and do it now and without delay.
In a period of heightened tensions, it is all the more important that we have reliable constraints on the competition in strategic nuclear weapons. SALT is an integral part of our national security policy. I remain committed to the ratification of this treaty, and the United States intends to abide by its obligations under international law and to take no action inconsistent with its intent or purpose, so long as the Soviets act with similar restraint.
But there will be people who want their own particular allocation of funds to be left untouched. Many of them may not want to vote for me because of the decisions I made. But when our Nation has a problem on housing or transportation, on agriculture, on steel, on coal, on cities, on any other element of our life, that the problem winds up here on this desk—and the same problems relate to national defense, the same problems relate to American hostages, the same problems relate to national security—the problems wind up on this desk, and I am the only person who is elected in this Nation that can match all those problems with possible solutions, tap the tremendous strength and resources of our Nation and make judgments accordingly. And I make my recommendations on budget matters to the Congress, and they act with their particular insight. But I can't promise you an easy solution to very difficult problems. It would be misleading.
The most difficult, single job in the entire crucial effort in our country to save energy and to give us better national security is to convince every single American that he or she, as just one individual, can take action that will truly be significant. The cumulative effect of that is profound, but it's difficult to convince every person that their small part can be meaningful.
As I'm sure you know, the Presidential Medal of Freedom is the highest civilian award given in this Nation. The medal was first presented by President Truman during the time of World War II to honor especially meritorious nonmilitary contributions to national security and to world peace. Since I've been in office, I've given the Medal of Freedom to three people: Justice Arthur Goldberg, to Jonas Salk, and to Martin Luther King, Jr.
Some of you expressed your personal concern to me about defense expenditures and increases, but in spite of your expressions of concern I decided to stand firm because of the overriding need for national security. Above everything else, the number one responsibility on the shoulders of a President is to provide for and to guarantee our Nation's security, and through it to preserve peace for ourselves and peace for people around the world.
And the third thing is when our own national security is at stake, which it is in the Iranian crisis, whether the visit by misguided Americans like Clark might exacerbate an already serious situation and cause further damages either to the hostages or to the Iranian relationships with the outside world is an additional factor. So, those are the bases on which the order was issued.
Three basic ideas ran through our discussions today. The first is that the best possible policy for our countries, as we face a time of danger, change, and testing in the 1980's, is a policy that seeks both strong defense of national security and lasting world peace, for the plain truth is that the one is necessary to the other.
The third basic idea that ran through our discussions today is that national security and world peace can only be achieved by maintaining a strong and united Atlantic Alliance. Just as the best form of government is self-government, so the strongest cement of any alliance is free will. Ours is an alliance of independent democracies. We draw strength both from our common traditions and our individual differences.
Our intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic security and also threatens our national security. And America's energy security is the key to both, because all three of those—economic, national, and energy—are links in the same chain of America's security.
In closing, let me say that following the signing of this proclamation, young men who were born in 1960 and in 1961 will be required to register at the post offices in their local communities. This will not mean that they are being drafted. It means that we are expediting the process by which, if our Nation enters a time of emergency or a threat to our national security or a time of war in the future, the marshaling of our defense mechanisms can be expedited. It's a precautionary measure; it's designed to make our country strong and to maintain peace.
We face great challenges—not yet easy to understand or predict—in energy, in health, in agriculture, in national security, in science, in the quest for peace, in economic innovation, in productivity, and we will face even greater challenges in the next century.
There is no easy answer to the complex question that faces our Nation in any of the areas that you've discussed in the last few days, even here in Washington. Energy, national security, the role of government-how to do it efficiently and at the same time humanely—in meeting the needs of our people are very difficult questions. Those that I receive on my desk in the Oval Office are issues and questions that cannot be resolved, even with the best intention and the most careful focusing of attention, at the country courthouse or the city hall or the State capitol or the State legislatures of our country.
This first award is for all of you and for all FFA members throughout the Nation who couldn't be here this morning. "The President's Award for Energy Efficiency is awarded to the Future Farmers of America in recognition of outstanding contribution to America's economic and national security through exemplary leadership in the national effort to achieve energy efficiency." Signed, Jimmy Carter, the White House, July 31, 1980.
In the long run, nothing is more crucial to the future of America than energy; nothing was so disastrously neglected in the past. Long after the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Republicans in the White House had still done nothing to meet the threat to the national security of our Nation. Then, as now, their policy was dictated by the big oil companies.
This morning, as Commander in Chief, I want to talk to you very briefly and very frankly about some of the problems that we face, some of the achievements that we've had, some of the uncertainties about the future, and how you can help. As Commander in Chief of America's Armed Forces, working with the Congress, I have the final responsibility for making those difficult choices. They are critical choices. They are far from simple. I need your support and your understanding based on experience in the Armed Forces in understanding the real choices that we face in defense and in the broader realm of national security policy.
America requires the authority and the strength—and the moral force—to protect ourselves, to provide for the defense of our friends, and to promote the values of human dignity and well-being that have made our own Nation strong at home and respected abroad. To this end, our national security policy has four specific objectives.
Recently there's been a great deal of press and public attention paid to a Presidential directive that I have issued, known as PD-59. As a new President charged with great responsibilities for the defense of this Nation, I decided that our Nation must have flexibility in responding to a possible nuclear attack—in responding to a possible nuclear attack. Beginning very early in my term, working with the Secretaries of State and Defense and with my own national security advisers, we have been evolving such an improved capability. It's been recently revealed to the public in outline form by Secretary of Defense Harold Brown. It's a carefully considered, logical, and evolutionary improvement in our Nation's defense capability and will contribute to the prevention of a nuclear conflict.
It should be clear to everyone who studies national security or defense that our work to keep America the strongest nation in the world is not finished. There are no laurels on which to rest. There are no victories which are final. There are no challenges which have disappeared magically. But we've resumed a firm and steady course of diplomacy and defense preparedness to lead our allies and our friends and ourselves with confidence toward the challenges facing the world of today and the world of tomorrow.
The independence, the security, and the development of the countries of the Third World, the small nations, the new nations, the developing nations, the nonaligned nations, are also very important to our national security. Violence and radical revolution thrive in an atmosphere of political repression, economic want, massive unemployment, and hunger. Our interest is served when the countries of the developing world are able to meet the needs and aspirations of their people peacefully, democratically, and through cooperation with the United States of America and the other Western nations.
In some areas, such as national security, as you all know, government must play the dominant role. But where government is involved in the economic sphere it will function best not as a boss, but to assist or to cooperate with business and labor only as it's necessary. This can be done. We are cooperating properly now in dealing with coal, steel, and the automobile industries, as well as in many aspects, particularly the new ones, involving our energy program.
As an alternative, all they offer is the wan hope that if we just give the oil companies enough money, they'll solve the energy problem for us and maybe help to shape our foreign policy at the same time. We must be very careful about this. The new Republican leaders do not seem to recognize the cost of foreign oil dependence-not just the financial cost, not just the cost in joblessness and inflation, but the foreign policy cost and the national security costs as well. To abandon conservation, to abandon our energy program could be to take the destiny of our Nation out of our own hands and put it in the hands of OPEC. We must not permit that. You should consider very carefully who might be Secretary of Energy or Secretary of State in a different administration next year.
At the same time, we will stand by our commitments to control nuclear arms. As long as I'm President, the United States will not initiate a pointless and a dangerous nuclear arms race. We'll continue to work for the control of nuclear weapons. Mutual and balanced nuclear arms control is not some sentimental act of charity. It's not a favor we're doing for some other nation. It's essential to our own national security.
On the first day of May, I went to the U.S.S. Nimitz to point out to them how much our Nation appreciates what they and others have done for our country. I said to the crew on Memorial Day that the pay or benefits or privileges that are given to them, however much they might be raised, could never fully reward those who put their lives on the line in the service of our country, but it's important that those who do so must be adequately compensated. This is important, not only for reasons of fairness but also for reasons of national security. It's a great loss to our country to have a well-trained military person who, because of excessive financial burdens on the family, have to resign from the military to seek a way to sustain their own loved ones.
So, to all of you I say thank you, who have played a role in this. And I think the gratifying thing about it, Mr. President, with your cooperation and your enthusiastic support, we are signing into law today, and you've signed into law, a measure that will not only help the young men and women who serve in our military forces, but most importantly, it will help contribute to the protection of our national security. So, I say thank you to you, Mr. President.
This corporation for energy security is a cornerstone of our national energy policy. It's our main instrument in cutting down the intolerable overdependence of our Nation on imported oil from, primarily, the OPEC nations. This threatens our economic vitality and also our national security. The Corporation will use American resources, American knowledge, and American labor to encourage a production of 2 million barrels per day of synthetic fuels by 1992. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs specifically to design and to build and to operate these plants, which will turn our coal and our shale, our tar sands and other resources into synthetic fuels.
