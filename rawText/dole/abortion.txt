The first acts of every President define his administration. President Clinton launched his with a series of executive orders forcing abortion even further into American life. One required federally funded family planning clinics to provide abortion counseling. Another provided American tax dollars to overseas groups promoting abortion as a method of family planning. And another instructed the Department of Health and Human Services to assess ways to promote the testing and licensing of an abortion pill.
In a Dole administration, abortion on demand will no longer be the policy of the federal government. As long as we hold the White House, federal agencies will be in the business of licensing drugs that promote life, not death. And our federal tax dollars will not be used to promote abortion overseas.
We talk all day about children's issues, as liberals often do. But it will be just that — hollow talk — if we don't have enough love in our hearts to care for the most innocent among us. All our talk about a less violent, more caring society will come to nothing unless we protect the sanctity of human life. Until the day comes when we overturn Roe v. Wade, why can't we require parental consent before a minor obtains an abortion? Why can't we stop partial birth abortions? Why can't we get the government out of the business of promoting abortions? The truth is, we can — and with the right leadership in the White House — we will.
"Steve Forbes has run a one-dimensional, single-issue campaign," Merrill said. "A one-on-one debate would give people a chance to learn that on a wide range of social issues -- from welfare to immigration to abortion to gays in the military -- Steve Forbes' views are much closer to Bill Clinton's than to the average Republican voter."
He said he wanted to make abortions rare. But his policies are confined to taking the extreme position of vetoing Congress' ban on partial-birth abortions. As President, I will sign the partial-birth abortion bill into law.
But there's a lot more common ground in the Republican Party than the other kind. And we need to spend our time talking about issues we agree on, because that's about 90 percent. And I hope I made a big step forward last week in reaching out to everybody on the abortion issue. In my view, we're moving in the right direction.
We don't think that platform week is going to be "abortion week." We think platform week will deal with a number of issues. There'll be some real debate on issues as relating to trade, as relates to taxes, relating to a number of issues.
The abortion plank of the Republican Party Platform remains pro-life, It also reflects that ours is the party of the open door. The plank recognizes that there are differing views on the issue of abortion and the principle of tolerance for those who may disagree is expressed in diversity language included in the plank.
What we have in the opinions of millions of Americans is crime and drugs, illegitimacy, abortion, the abdication of duty, and the abandonment of children.
When I get the partial birth abortion bill, I'll sign it, I won't veto it, I'll sign it.
"Last April, President Clinton vetoed a bipartisan bill, including an exception for the life of the mother, to prevent the horrible practice known as partial birth abortion. As more and more Americans have learned the details of this procedure, the President has been left almost alone, defending the indefensible.
"People of good will are divided on the abortion issue. But on the issue of partial birth abortion, we are not divided. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan spoke for a broad consensus when he described the practice as 'too close to infanticide.' Like Representatives Richard Gephardt and David Bonier, Senator Moynihan could not in good conscience stand with his president on this issue.
"The President claims that partial birth abortion is necessary when unusual prenatal complications arise. He is disputed by most specialists in obstetrics, gynecology, pediatrics, and maternal and fetal medicine. Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has said that the president is being mislead by his medical advisors. He concludes: 'In no way can I twist my mind to see that the late term abortion as described -- you know, partial birth, and then destruction of the unborn child before the head is born -- is a medical necessity for the mother. It certainly can't be a necessity for the baby. So I am opposed to... partial birth abortion.'
Claim: The partial birth abortion ban bill would not have protected health of the mother.
The Truth: False. Senator Dole added an amendment to allow the use of the partial-birth abortion in extreme cases, if the mother's life was in danger. The President vetoed the ban on partial-birth abortions despite the fact that 65% of those who call themselves pro- choice are opposed to partial birth abortion.
And let me say, finally, this. I know abortion's an issue some people don't want to even talk about. And whether you're pro-choice or pro-life, there's a procedure called the partial birth abortion that ought to be stopped...
But I would say 80-some percent of all Americans, regardless of their stand on pro-life, pro-choice or abortion generally, are opposed to the partial birth abortion.
And if you send me a partial-birth abortion bill, I will sign it. I will not veto it. And I don't care what your view is on abortion — pro-life or pro-choice — if you understood this procedure, you would be against it.
And whatever you feel about abortion — if you understood this procedure, when Dr. Koop says it's never, never, never necessary. It's never necessary. He vetoed it. He vetoed it — but again tried to have it both ways as he always does.
You send me the partial-birth abortion bill and I will sign it. I will not veto it.
And you may have different views on abortion. Maybe pro-choice or maybe pro-life. But if you understood this procedure, you would not be for it.
And that's what Jack and I will do in our administration — more and more back to the states, back to the people, closer to the people, closer to the people. And I'll tell you one other thing, you send me the partial birth abortion bill and I'll sign it. I will not veto it.
We can have different views. We can have different views on the issue of abortion — pro-choice, pro-life. But Dr. Koop was very pro-choice, said this procedure is never necessary. It's, in fact, unnecessary. And if you could ever see the procedure, you would never support it. President Clinton, of course like its double-talk, he said well I would sign it if they'd do this, this and this. I offered the amendment myself to protect the life of the mother. It passed 99 to zero in the United States Senate. So we knew what we were doing. But he said, oh well I'm going to veto this.
And you send me the partial-birth abortion ban and I'll sign it. I won't veto it.
And whatever your views on abortion may be — whether your pro-life or pro-choice this is a procedure that is terrible. It's late term. It's totally unnecessary according not to me, but to Dr. Evert Koop who happens to be pro-choice. Said it's never necessary, it could harm the mother and what did President Clinton do? What he always does he said well if he'd done this or this or this I would have signed it. Well we offered amendment, in fact it was my amendment I was still on the senate then, protect the life of the mother. But he still vetoed it. You send it to Bob Dole and I will sign it to protect that child, to protect that child and also to protect that mother.
And you send me the partial-birth abortion bill, and I will sign it.
