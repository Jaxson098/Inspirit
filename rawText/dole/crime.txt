But America today is a society in which law-abiding citizens feel increasingly at risk. You know the figures. Each and every year), some 43 million Americans are victims of crime. Some 11 million Americans are victims of violent crime.
Most Americans surely share the concerns of FBI Director Louis Freeh, who said that crime remains, quote, "at intolerable levels," and warned of the disturbing skyrocketing violent crimes by juveniles.
And there are many reasons for the crime explosion — the proliferation of drugs, the almost-total obliteration of the family and the welfare culture of the inner city, where as many as 80 percent of all children are born out of wedlock and too many into a life of neglect.
But today I want to address another issue, one that is also devastating. And if we're looking for root causes of the crime explosion, this is clearly one of them. I am speaking of the crisis in our courts, the crisis in our legal system, and the crisis of confidence this is causing in America.
So let's have an instant check. Let's have it national. And et's reduce the rate of crimes committed with guns, whether it's family members or whether it's somebody else. That will be my suggestion to the American people. And I believe it's a good one. I believe it will have bipartisan support.
The president's rhetoric is tough on crime, but his actions are to appoint judges like Judge Harold Baer of New York who have made careers of getting tough on cops.
The good news from our perspective when we deal with these voters and our goals in this convention, is that the issue agenda that we need to get their attention has been an historical Republican issue agenda. It's economics, it's taxes, it's welfare reform, it's crime and drugs.
We think platform week, however, will be more an opportunity for us to talk about some of the bigger issues. And those bigger issues include the problem with crimes and the problem with drug increases in the schools and the problem of over-taxation and over-regulation. And we're going to use platform week to talk about those issues as opposed to focus on simply one or two of the things.
But what we've determined is that the issue agenda that women care about are the exact issues that are Republican issues that we're going to be talking about. They're very concerned about crime. They're very concerned about the quality of their education.
The document states that under Bill Clinton's tenure, violent crime has turned American homes into prisons and streets and schoolyards into battlegrounds. Recognizing that while the federal governments role is essential, law enforcement must remain in the hands Of local communities, directed by state and local officials. The Platform encourages:
To combat surging juvenile crime, the Platform promises to stress accountability at every step in the system and require adult trials for Juveniles who commit adult crimes. The Platform also recognizes the forgotten rights of victims by proposing a Constitutional amendment to protect victim"s rights.
What we have in the opinions of millions of Americans is crime and drugs, illegitimacy, abortion, the abdication of duty, and the abandonment of children.
And if we want to reduce crime -- if we want to reduce crime and drug use and teen pregnancies, let's start by giving all our children a first-class education.
We are a nation paralyzed by crime. And it's time to end that in America.
And to do so, I mean to attack the root cause of crime -- criminals, criminals, violent criminals.
If we're going to get a handle on crime, teen pregnancy, drugs, all these things that threaten young people, we'd better take a look at education. We'd better break this hammer lock the unions and the bureaucrats have on education and give the schools...
The view many Americans see this morning is a sobering one. We are troubled about the direction our country is taking. Our values are under constant assault from our public and cultural institutions. We feel threatened by the random incidents of violent crime. Too many of our schools, which were once passports to opportunity, have become demoralizing places. Welfare has become a misery subsidy fostering illegitimacy and generations of dependency. And yet the deficit keeps growing, taxes keep increasing, and the government keeps demanding more and more authority over our lives.
There is one area where the Federal government must work in partnership with our state and local governments -- and that area is crime. Today, a criminal committing a serious crime has less than a ten percent chance of going to jail. And once in jail that criminal will serve only a fraction of his sentence.
We should put an end to parole for violent offenders. Put limits on the endless and often frivolous appeals clogging our courts. Remove teenagers who commit serious, violent crimes from juvenile courts and try them as adults. We should be more concerned with the rights of victims than the privileges of criminals. And we must rededicate ourselves to the war on drugs.
And speaking of picking up the money, later this year the Senate will revisit the 1994 Crime Bill. As part of this effort, we will transform the $9 billion police-hiring program into a law-enforcement block grant, giving states and cities the flexibility they need to fight crime on their streets, not statistics in a national trend. What does your city need most? Is it more police? Or better technology? Maybe it's more squad cars. One thing for sure, you don't need more opinions from Washington bureaucrats. You are on the front lines in the war against crime and you must be given a free hand to fight it.
It is my belief that our block grant legislation should differ in three ways from President Clinton's proposal. First, it should provide more resources for law enforcement, perhaps as much as $12 billion total. Second, as I have mentioned, it should provide more flexibility for Mayors and local officials. And finally, it should target a portion of the funds to those cities that are in the most urgent need of help — cities with the highest violent crime rates.
That it is ultimately more important to punish crime than to explain it.
And yes, this means speaking out about our popular culture and entertainment - the most powerful and pervasive teacher of our children. It is harder to rise out of poverty when your culture derides the values that make that effort possible. It is harder to control crime when "role models" preach impulsive violence.
Yes, this means braving the ridicule of the cultural elites and speaking out about our popular entertainment. Our movies and music, advertising and television are having a profound impact on our children. And it's not for the good. It's much harder to rise out of poverty when the culture derides the values that make that possible. It's much harder for society to control crime when "role models" preach impulsive violence. Those who would market evil through commerce hate the light of scrutiny, but I will continue to use my freedom to call them to account. I will name their names until they feel the shame their actions deserve. Time Warner — the producers of some of the foulest rap music — has already begun to have second thoughts, and others will, too. This is not a matter of right and left, it is a matter of right and wrong. And I hope you will join me.
Clearly, Forbes meant he was for truth in sentencing for first time offenders, but against three strikes mandatory sentencing laws. Despite his millions, Forbes can't escape the logic of his own words. He was talking about truth in sentencing for first time offenders -- the "one strike" he mentioned -- as his preferred approach to fighting crime. Forbes is 50% right. Bob Dole supports both ideas -- truth in sentencing and mandatory three strikes laws. Bob Dole is 100% right.
Today the twisted story of Forbes and crime continues, with a Forbes aide telling the Leader "Steve Forbes supports mandatory life sentences for first offenders for violent crimes and he has said that many times." Apart from the question of exactly where he said such a thing, this again contradicts Forbes' original statement to the Union Leader "If you are sentenced to 10 years, you will serve 10 years." But 10 years imprisonment is clearly a felony sentence -- and a serious one at that. How can Forbes talk about a 10 year sentence for a serious felony at the same time he calls for a life sentence for the same kind of crime?
And let's speak the truth for a moment about crime in America. It's true that violent crime is down slightly from historically high levels. But is also true that we could soon be faced with a new wave of violent crime, unleashed by what Professor John DiIulio of Princeton calls "Super Predators" — young criminals who are totally merciless ... capable of committing the most vicious of acts for the most trivial reasons: a pair of sneakers A football jersey. A misplaced glance mistaken for disrespect.
Teenagers who commit violent crimes should be prosecuted as adults and should receive sentences commensurate to the danger they represent to society.
And, as New Hampshire knew more than 200 years ago, we must find hope in the genius of the states. We will find in this body, and in others like it across America, our greatest hope for reforming welfare, fixing our schools and protecting our people from crime. In fact, all our hopes are united by one conviction: that we must return power to where it comes from and where it belongs: to families and communities, to states and to citizens.
And now we're in another time and the issues haven't changed that much. They're about the economy, they're about jobs, they're about crime, they're about healthcare. The issues never seem to change a great deal.
But ask, Bob why are you running for president? What is your vision for America? And these are all very good questions and you ought to know the answers. I know that America's headed in the wrong direction. I know we're not taking care of our children. I know there's too much crime and there's too much drugs and there's too many young people graduating from high school who can't find California on the map. We've got major problems in America. That's my vision for America.
But America today is a society in which law-abiding citizens feel increasingly at risk. You know the figures. Each and every year), some 43 million Americans are victims of crime. Some 11 million Americans are victims of violent crime.
Most Americans surely share the concerns of FBI Director Louis Freeh, who said that crime remains, quote, "at intolerable levels," and warned of the disturbing skyrocketing violent crimes by juveniles.
And there are many reasons for the crime explosion — the proliferation of drugs, the almost-total obliteration of the family and the welfare culture of the inner city, where as many as 80 percent of all children are born out of wedlock and too many into a life of neglect.
But today I want to address another issue, one that is also devastating. And if we're looking for root causes of the crime explosion, this is clearly one of them. I am speaking of the crisis in our courts, the crisis in our legal system, and the crisis of confidence this is causing in America.
So let's have an instant check. Let's have it national. And et's reduce the rate of crimes committed with guns, whether it's family members or whether it's somebody else. That will be my suggestion to the American people. And I believe it's a good one. I believe it will have bipartisan support.
The president's rhetoric is tough on crime, but his actions are to appoint judges like Judge Harold Baer of New York who have made careers of getting tough on cops.
Americans feel threatened by random incidents of violent crime. Bob Dole recognizes that many schools that once were passports to opportunity have become demoralizing, fear-ridden places.
Bob Dole has fought for the toughest drug laws in our history: no parole for violent offenders, mandatory sentences for those convicted of crimes using a gun, and the appointment of conservative judges that will end liberal judicial policy. Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce to you a genuine American hero, Bob Dole of Kansas.
Those of us in the political world talk a lot about fighting crime. But you're on the front lines every day, safeguarding our communities and protecting our streets. I salute each and every one of you, and I know everybody here salutes all these fine people all over America who lay their lives on the line every day.
Most Americans need little convincing that we have a crime problem of very serious dimensions in this country. When people say our country is headed in the wrong direction, one of the first things they cite is the explosion of crime. And I've seen America come through some tough challenges in my lifetime, and we have a few more challenges ahead. And I am hopeful because I know that whatever the problems we face, Americans will have what it takes to resolve them.
But I think there is a general feeling that in our criminal justice system, something has gone terribly wrong. We all know the problems. More than 43 million of our fellow citizens are victims of crime each year.
Eleven million of these are violent. But only one in 100 violent crimes ends up in a jail sentence. Yet, when criminals are caught by police and brought to trial, they may never do time.
Our two parties have embraced two different visions of crime and punishment. Until fairly recently, the debate in America was how to catch and punish wrongdoers, not whether to punish them, or whether they were even wrongdoers.
The liberal view is that crime and violence are not so much punishable offenses as treatable disorders. But the liberal philosophy is not the solution to our crime problem. In fact, it's part of the problem.
And Bill Clinton's legacy is already clear. It includes a startling number of appointees more faithful to the liberal orthodoxy than to the traditional notions of crime and punishment.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, last week we learned about another disgrace. We found out that one of the president's top political adviser also helped an accused rapist beat the rap. The same p.r. consultant who has been helping Bill Clinton pose as a crime fighter has been moonlighting for an accused rapist in Connecticut, advising the rapist's legal team on techniques for selecting an easy going jury.
Now the truth is, if Bill Clinton had done more to fight crime, if he had appointed people serious about fighting crime, he wouldn't need a high-priced p.r. man to help him with the issue.
The single most important thing a president can do to fight crime is to put crime fighters in our courtrooms, both on the bench and at the prosecutor's table. And when I am the president that is exactly what I will do.
Now last year, the president proudly announced a slight one-year drop in the violent crime rate. In 1994, more than 23,000 people were murdered, a decline of five percent. And this was proof, he said, that America was moving in the right direction.
And ours is the age of violence without feeling, feeling guilt, and without remorse — the paroled child molester, the drive-by shooting, the thrill shooting, wilding, the serial killer, the mail bomber. And women in America know better than anyone about the randomness and ruthlessness of crime.
The sheriff just told me about the rising rate of juvenile crime. The murder rate among 14-to 17-year-olds more than doubled, rising 172 percent between 1985 and 1994.
Thirty-five percent of all violent crime is now committed by offenders less than 20 years of age. And I think you told me that 18.
Rebuilding the family is the best juvenile crime prevention program we could hope for, and we can start by reforming welfare. And last week I announced...
He finds out I'm giving you a speech on welfare reform, then claims he's been for it all along. He hears my proposals on juvenile crime and then rushes forward a couple of days later and calls for curfews on teenagers.
When he promises to cut taxes, then imposes the largest tax cut in history; when he talks tough on crime, and then appoints weak judges and prosecutors; when he pledges welfare reform, but blocks welfare reform not once, but twice; Bill Clinton invites the American people to ask whether or not he can be trusted, and the harsh light of public scrutiny will not be kind.
"That's right, the White House has now been forced to admit that Bill Clinton's aides used their power with the F.B.I. to gain access to the private files on some of Clinton's top political adversaries. The group reads like a Clinton 'enemies list'- Bush Secretary of State Jim Baker, Reagan Chief of Staff Ken Duberstein, even Newt Gingrich's Press Secretary Tony Blankley, and over 300 more law abiding citizens whose only crime was to oppose Bill Clinton.
The good news from our perspective when we deal with these voters and our goals in this convention, is that the issue agenda that we need to get their attention has been an historical Republican issue agenda. It's economics, it's taxes, it's welfare reform, it's crime and drugs.
We think platform week, however, will be more an opportunity for us to talk about some of the bigger issues. And those bigger issues include the problem with crimes and the problem with drug increases in the schools and the problem of over-taxation and over-regulation. And we're going to use platform week to talk about those issues as opposed to focus on simply one or two of the things.
But what we've determined is that the issue agenda that women care about are the exact issues that are Republican issues that we're going to be talking about. They're very concerned about crime. They're very concerned about the quality of their education.

The Platform also recognizes the forgotten rights of victims by proposing a Constitutional amendment to protect victim"s rights.
We look at drugs, look at crime, look at opportunities for children. If we want to restrain the use of drugs, if we want to restrain out-of-wedlock births, if we want to get a handle on crime, let's give our children a good education. And that, as I said earlier, is part of this program.
If we want to stop crime and stop drugs, and stop out-of-wedlock births, we give kids a good education. Yes. Children of low income Americans get a good education, and we're going to do that.
What we have in the opinions of millions of Americans is crime and drugs, illegitimacy, abortion, the abdication of duty, and the abandonment of children.
And if we want to reduce crime -- if we want to reduce crime and drug use and teen pregnancies, let's start by giving all our children a first-class education.
We are a nation paralyzed by crime. And it's time to end that in America.
And to do so, I mean to attack the root cause of crime -- criminals, criminals, violent criminals.
Now, let's talk about crime and drugs for a moment, because, heaven knows, this is an area that affects our society today, that's undermining our families.
As we all know, drug use among youth has been skyrocketing in the last three years; 13 years there was a decline. Now, marijuana use is skyrocketing -- also, LSD, cocaine, the rest. So, we've got a major problem that has to be turned around. And we're going to fight crime and fight drugs and it's going to be an all-out war.
Bob Dole is going to appoint judges who'll be tough on crime, tough on crime, as strict constructionists.
We want one clear message that echoes across America from the schoolhouse to the White House, and that is that drug use or drug abuse is wrong. And we're going to add to that in our administration. The judges we will appoint will be tough on crime. They're going to worry about the victims instead of the criminals.
The best way to start cutting out crime and teen pregnancy and drugs is to give that child a good education — give that child a good education.
Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are committed to participating in a set of debates this fall to discuss the issues that affect the lives of all Americans: the economy, crime, drugs, and the security of our nation. We look forward to presenting our agenda for lower taxes, faster economic growth, smaller government, and stronger, safer families.

Hello, I'm Bob Dole. I'm joined today by Michigan Governor John Engler to talk with you about one of the greatest threats facing our communities and our country: the epidemic of drugs and violent crime,
The statistics are truly staggering. In 1994, the American people were victimized by more than 42 million crimes, including nearly 11 million violet crimes — many committed by convicted criminals who were released from prison before their sentence was up. The economic cost of this mayhem was more than $400 billion. But the human cost in lost and shattered lives can not even begin to be calculated. Drug use among our youth has more than doubled just since President Clinton took office. And since drugs lead to violence, it's no surprise that youth violence is also on the rise. In fact, many experts predict that juvenile arrests will double within the next 15 years.
There is much I would do as President that Bill Clinton has not done to stem the tide of violent crime and drugs, including appointing judges and Prosecutors who will protect the rights of crime victims, and not expand the rights of criminals
On Monday, I will be joined by many of America's outstanding Republican Governors in announcing our action plan to combat drugs and violent crime. And one of the Governors who has done an outstanding job in battling crime in his state is Michigan's John Engler.
Together, we are more committed than ever to warning the war on drugs and violent crime. Our families deserve safe streets, and my fellow Republican Governors know that Bob Dole is the best man to get the job done.
On issue after issue, when it comes to fighting crime, Bob Dole is a leader. For example, Bob Dole proposed an innovative national instant check system to keep all guns out of the hands of criminals.
And Bob Dole is fighting to accomplish at a national level what we have accomplished in Michigan--reforming our criminal justice system so that violent juvenile offenders are held responsible and serve adult time for adult crime.
Third, we will, as Governor Engler mentioned, hold violent juveniles--who now commit over 35% of violent crimes--accountable for their actions.
Fourth, we will reform our prisons into places where productive work is the rule, not the exception. I believe able-bodied prisoners should work to offset the costs of incarceration and pay compensation to the victims of their crimes.
My fellow Americans, a nation that cannot defend itself from violence against its citizens will not survive. It is time we stop making excuses for the criminals and start protecting the victims of crime.

Bob Dole has always sent a clear message to America's young people that illegal drug use is wrong.

* "George Bush promised to make streets safe from drug-related crime ... he broke that promise."
And it ties in to what I'll talk to in a couple of minutes about crime and drugs.
And that is why today here in Philadelphia, historic Philadelphia, I want to focus on a subject that justifiably is on the minds of every parent, every school teacher, every woman who has to walk home alone at night, and every student — violent crime and drugs.
What works in combatting crime is no mystery. It begins with the understanding that the cause of crime can be explained with one simple word — criminals. Criminals. Criminals.
But I'm also saying that too often the current administration in Washington because of their ideology and their fixation on liberal responses to crime, has emphasized what doesn't over what does work. And I am saying that as president of the United States, I will have a simple straightforward plan to make America safer again — safer for the mothers who now keep their families behind locked doors.
Four out of five Americans — four out of five — can expect to be a violent crime victim at least once in their lives. More Americans die at the hands of murderers every three years as died in combat during the Vietnam War. And one of the biggest causes of economic poverty today is the moral poverty that breeds crimes. The moral poverty that breeds crimes.
And maybe everybody knows it in this audience, but every time I read the number it surprises me. Particular alarming — 35 percent of all violent crime is now committed by teenagers — 35 percent. The number of murders by juveniles has more than doubled over the last decade. And all experts point to evermore random violence among young people.
The program I'm announcing today is to combat drugs and combat violent crime. Now, some may think they're two separate issues. They're not. They're not separate.
The simple fact is that drug abuse, particularly among young people, leads to more criminal activity, and that criminal activity leads to violent crime. This is the crime pipeline.
And for most of these young criminals, it will be far more than just one act of violent crime. Crime and violence will become a lifestyle choice, believe it or not.
From 1979 to 1992, overall drug use in America dropped 50 percent — 50 percent. But President Clinton has opened the crime pipeline up again. And thanks to the liberal "wink-and-nod" policies of this administration, drug use among teenagers has not just started up again, it's skyrocketing upward — as former Drug Czar Bill Bennett can confirm.
And while the administration's looked the other way on drugs, a tragic number of America's youth have gone the wrong way on crime. It began almost the day this administration was sworn in when they cut the drug czar's office, or drug policy office, control office by 83 percent — 83 percent.
Now I want to make it clear. None of these actions of course were taken out of bad motives. But they do all reflect the administration's old liberal view that law enforcement is less important than social engineering and attacking crime and that drugs are really not nothing or anything to get worked up about.
And the same liberalism keeps showing itself throughout the administration's crime policies. Yes, the president talks about being tough on crime, but as with so much else that this administration does, his actions tell a different story than his words. He talks like Dirty Harry, but he acts like Barney Fife.
Well, what happened while they were out there? They committed 79 murders, 90 rapes, 701 burglaries, 959 robberies, 1,113 assaults, 2,715 drug dealing crimes, and 2,748 thefts.
As a matter of policy, they've adopted a new and risky rule of not requiring U.S. attorneys to prosecute the most serious crimes that a suspect stands accused of, believe it or not.
So from packing the federal court with ideological liberals to running up the white flag in the war on drugs to taking a go easy approach in prosecuting criminals, this administration's crime policies can be summed up in the phrase, Speak loud but carry a small stick. Probably no stick at all.
So it's time to end the phony conservative rhetoric that tries to mask liberalism in action. It's time to return to what works in fighting crime. What works in fighting crime is fighting criminals. I can't find any other thing, any other thing that works.
So I want to lay out some things we wish to do, and I want to share the point that Jack Kemp made. I don't want anybody involved in crime. It's ties into our economic package. We want young people to have families. We want to keep families together.
And first and foremost, we will close down the drugs to crime to violent crime pipeline. And my goal will be to cut teenage drug use in America by 50 percent in my first term in office as president of the United States — 50 percent.
In other words, as president, both by action and teaching, I will work to close off the opening to the crime pipeline.
The second point in my action plan against violent crime and drugs is to work with the nation's governors to end the revolving door justice system by taking such measures as abolishing parole for violent criminals — abolishing parole for violent criminals.
As president, to make certain this happens, I will double federal funding for state prison construction so that the governors can help us put violent — let me underscore violent — criminals in prison, and keep them in prison where they can't commit crimes.
We want to give people incentives for entrepreneurship in those areas. We want to transform these areas from combat zones to enterprise zones, with hope and opportunity and jobs available for people to keep them off drugs and keep them out of crime in the first place, as I said earlier. This is the real goal of Bob Dole and Jack Kemp, but we can't wait for that to happen. But we're going to work on it.
And third point in my action plan is to hold juvenile criminals fully accountable for their crimes — fully accountable.
And of course we don't want them entering crime at all in the first place. We hope it never happens. But the best preventive message is the simplest. If you commit an adult crime, you will serve adult time. That will be the message from my administration.
And if we can make it clear to young people who might be tempted into crime of any sort, that it does not pay, and in fact there is a cost, we may be able to save thousands and thousands from taking that tragic lifestyle choice. That is the ultimate goal, and will be the ultimate goal in our administration.
And the fourth point in my plan against violent crimes and drugs is to make prisoners work. Make prisoners work once they're incarcerated. Make prisoners work.
We will put federal prisoners to work full-time and use the earnings of their labor to help compensate the victims of their crime. Compensate the victims of their crimes.
First the cost of the crime to society as a whole, and secondly, the cost of supporting the convicted criminals in prison. We will work at the federal level and with the states to enact these reforms and make prison what it should be, humane but hard — very hard.
And the final point, in this blueprint working with the governors to stop violent crime and to stop drugs is to take real and effective federal action, to keep guns out of the hands of violent criminals.
No one who's been convicted of a serious crime should be able to buy a gun, any gun, a handgun, a shotgun, a rifle, any gun.
And in my administration, Project Trigger Lock will become a number one priority again, as it should be. If you use a gun, you're going to get in trouble in a Dole-Kemp administration. If you use a gun in the commission of a crime, you're going to be in serious trouble in a Dole-Kemp administration.
So the bottom line is, as I conclude, is it's time to get serious about violent crime and drugs in a way that we have not seen in our government over the last four years.
And he noted — to quote him — "and I say to de-stigmatize crime would be to lift from it the weight of moral judgment and to make crime simply a particular occupation" — end of quote.
We must not allow that kind of moral poverty to take root in America. We must have leadership from the top that says through every means at its disposal that violent crime and drugs are wrong. Violent crime and drugs are wrong. Violent crime and drugs are wrong. And you'll think the record is stuck in a Dole-Kemp administration.
We're going to have leadership to shut down the crime pipeline. We're going to give a clear, unambiguous, emphatic no to the moral laxity that has allowed the crime pipeline to become so full over the last four years.
They're somebody's child, somebody's children, somebody who loves them. But in many cases, nobody loves them. No place to go. No place to turn. We'll create a 1,000 new community-based groups to help us in this effort. To help us with the children, help us with crime, help us with drugs. But, we can't make it happen unless we get elected. All these governors are going to a great job in their states.
And none of us are perfect. But some of us have different views and stronger convictions and more commitment. And we see it happening day after day after day, violent crime — violent crime. And so I thank you all for letting me be here today. I thank you for letting me participate with Jack Kemp and the governors and Tom Ridge, thank you very much.
Bob Dole and Jack Kemp understand that crime is a national problem that cannot be solved by the federal government alone. The federal government must work in partnership with state and local governments. Bob Dole's five-point Action Plan will serve as a blueprint for a new era of federal-state-local cooperation in ridding the American social landscape of the crime and drug scourges. As President, he will:
3. Hold violent juveniles accountable for their actions, Juveniles charged with serious violent federal crimes will be prosecuted as adults, Sentencing courts will be able to consider prior juvenile offenses.
4. Make prisoners work. Bob Dole will issue an Executive Order requiring able-bodied federal prisoners to work no less than 40 hours each week to help offset the costs of incarceration and pay compensation to the victims of their crimes.
Protect the rights of crime victims by:
* Appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution, not amend it to expand the rights of criminals. Ensuring that his federal prosecutors make defending the public's safety their number one priority. Supporting a Constitutional Amendment guaranteeing the victims of crime certain basic rights, including the right to be heard at sentencing, the right to object to plea agreements, and the right to a speedy trial.
And this, to me, is very, very significant. If we want to get a handle on drugs or crime or all the other things that plague young people, we better make certain they get a good education, starting with kindergarten, starting with kindergarten.
"White House aides used the same explanation for a speech last March in which Clinton related some dubious statistics on violence against women. He said-it violent crime is committed against a woman in this country every 12 seconds. Press Secretary Mike McCurry retracted that before the day was up. Also, the President claimed that up to 4 million American wives are the victims of domestic violence each year, a number that statistician David Murray told Ann Devroy of the Washington Post is probably 'five times too high. "Cannon, Weekly Standard, 10/2/95
And here in Ohio, just as in the rest of the parts of the country, people care about the quality of our schools. And that's why we're talking as part of our economic package, we're talking about something called opportunities scholarships. I like teachers. I like public schools. But we're looking at low income American families and low middle income families. A lot of them live in the inner cities and we're going to say to them, we're going to give you an opportunity scholarship because we want to stop drugs and crime and everything else that tempts teenagers. We're going to start with an education, starting in kindergarten, all the way through high school. And we're going to have opportunity scholarships.
And we're going to keep repeating the message of lower taxes, more money for your families, more money for your children, real leadership on crime and drugs, and an American foreign policy set by the president and not by the United Nations.
If we're going to stop crime and drugs and all the other things that happen with teenagers, they've got to have a good education. And it's got to start in kindergarten. And we're going to make certain it happens in a Dole-Kemp administration.
Now if we're gong to stop drugs and crime and all the other things that tempt young people, we've got to provide an education. So we're working on what we call our [audio gap] scholarships.
Now, take a look at your child or your children tonight and think about the future and think about their future and think about crime. President gets up, "Oh, we're going to have 100,000 police." You won't live long enough to see 100,000 police, his police on the street. It's only about 12,000 now, and a lot of the communities say, "We can't afford it."
Well, I know that Mrs. Yeutter's file was in that group. Here's one right here. Nice innocent person. Her only crime was being a Republican. Now, that will not happen in a Dole White House. That is an outrage. That is an outrage.
And government programs that started as temporary and limited have become permanent and broad, and it's increasingly clear that such preferences are irrelevant to the problems faced by many minorities: poor schools and violent crime and disappearing families.
It will work if we start at kindergarten right through grade 12. It will work. It will stop some of the crime and some of the drugs and some of the teen — give a child an education in America, Mr. President, give the child an education. Give a child an opportunity.
So, in any event, he'll be for that. But, we must understand that crime is also a civil rights issue. Forty-six percent of African-American adults say their greatest fear is violence against their children or children they know.
And no one suffers more from violent crime, repeat offenders than the large, silent decent majority in our inner cities. And no one would benefit more from keeping violent criminals behind bars which we will do in our administration.
Keep them locked up. They're not going to commit any crimes. If they commit a violent crime, they go to jail. And they stay in jail and they serve their time.
If you want to get a handle on drugs and crime and teen pregnancy and all the other things, start with an education in kindergarten all the way through high school and all the way through college.
They're concerned about drugs and crime and education. But their money is taken out of their check and put into the Clinton campaign. That's what's happening.
Let's do what we should do for our children when it comes to crime, when it comes to drugs, and we will do it in a Dole-Kemp administration.
Yes, this means braving the ridicule of the cultural elites and speaking out about our popular entertainment. Our movies and music, advertising and television are having a profound impact on our children. And it's not for the good. It's much harder to rise out of poverty when the culture derides the values that make that possible. It's much harder for society to control crime when "role models" preach impulsive violence. Those who would market evil through commerce hate the light of scrutiny, but I will continue to use my freedom to call them to account. I will name their names until they feel the shame their actions deserve. Time Warner — the producers of some of the foulest rap music — has already begun to have second thoughts, and others will, too. This is not a matter of right and left, it is a matter of right and wrong. And I hope you will join me.
And now we're in another time and the issues haven't changed that much. They're about the economy, they're about jobs, they're about crime, they're about healthcare. The issues never seem to change a great deal.
But ask, Bob why are you running for president? What is your vision for America? And these are all very good questions and you ought to know the answers. I know that America's headed in the wrong direction. I know we're not taking care of our children. I know there's too much crime and there's too much drugs and there's too many young people graduating from high school who can't find California on the map. We've got major problems in America. That's my vision for America.
But America today is a society in which law-abiding citizens feel increasingly at risk. You know the figures. Each and every year), some 43 million Americans are victims of crime. Some 11 million Americans are victims of violent crime.
Most Americans surely share the concerns of FBI Director Louis Freeh, who said that crime remains, quote, "at intolerable levels," and warned of the disturbing skyrocketing violent crimes by juveniles.
And there are many reasons for the crime explosion — the proliferation of drugs, the almost-total obliteration of the family and the welfare culture of the inner city, where as many as 80 percent of all children are born out of wedlock and too many into a life of neglect.
But today I want to address another issue, one that is also devastating. And if we're looking for root causes of the crime explosion, this is clearly one of them. I am speaking of the crisis in our courts, the crisis in our legal system, and the crisis of confidence this is causing in America.
So let's have an instant check. Let's have it national. And et's reduce the rate of crimes committed with guns, whether it's family members or whether it's somebody else. That will be my suggestion to the American people. And I believe it's a good one. I believe it will have bipartisan support.
The president's rhetoric is tough on crime, but his actions are to appoint judges like Judge Harold Baer of New York who have made careers of getting tough on cops.
He finds out I'm giving you a speech on welfare reform, then claims he's been for it all along. He hears my proposals on juvenile crime and then rushes forward a couple of days later and calls for curfews on teenagers.
When he promises to cut taxes, then imposes the largest tax cut in history; when he talks tough on crime, and then appoints weak judges and prosecutors; when he pledges welfare reform, but blocks welfare reform not once, but twice; Bill Clinton invites the American people to ask whether or not he can be trusted, and the harsh light of public scrutiny will not be kind.
What we have in the opinions of millions of Americans is crime and drugs, illegitimacy, abortion, the abdication of duty, and the abandonment of children.
And if we want to reduce crime -- if we want to reduce crime and drug use and teen pregnancies, let's start by giving all our children a first-class education.
We are a nation paralyzed by crime. And it's time to end that in America.
And to do so, I mean to attack the root cause of crime -- criminals, criminals, violent criminals.
Now, let's talk about crime and drugs for a moment, because, heaven knows, this is an area that affects our society today, that's undermining our families.
As we all know, drug use among youth has been skyrocketing in the last three years; 13 years there was a decline. Now, marijuana use is skyrocketing -- also, LSD, cocaine, the rest. So, we've got a major problem that has to be turned around. And we're going to fight crime and fight drugs and it's going to be an all-out war.
Bob Dole is going to appoint judges who'll be tough on crime, tough on crime, as strict constructionists.
And this, to me, is very, very significant. If we want to get a handle on drugs or crime or all the other things that plague young people, we better make certain they get a good education, starting with kindergarten, starting with kindergarten.

If you want to get a handle on drugs and crime and teen pregnancy and all the other things, start with an education in kindergarten all the way through high school and all the way through college.
And speaking of picking up the money, later this year the Senate will revisit the 1994 Crime Bill. As part of this effort, we will transform the $9 billion police-hiring program into a law-enforcement block grant, giving states and cities the flexibility they need to fight crime on their streets, not statistics in a national trend. What does your city need most? Is it more police? Or better technology? Maybe it's more squad cars. One thing for sure, you don't need more opinions from Washington bureaucrats. You are on the front lines in the war against crime and you must be given a free hand to fight it.
It is my belief that our block grant legislation should differ in three ways from President Clinton's proposal. First, it should provide more resources for law enforcement, perhaps as much as $12 billion total. Second, as I have mentioned, it should provide more flexibility for Mayors and local officials. And finally, it should target a portion of the funds to those cities that are in the most urgent need of help — cities with the highest violent crime rates.
That it is ultimately more important to punish crime than to explain it.
And yes, this means speaking out about our popular culture and entertainment - the most powerful and pervasive teacher of our children. It is harder to rise out of poverty when your culture derides the values that make that effort possible. It is harder to control crime when "role models" preach impulsive violence.

And let's speak the truth for a moment about crime in America. It's true that violent crime is down slightly from historically high levels. But is also true that we could soon be faced with a new wave of violent crime, unleashed by what Professor John DiIulio of Princeton calls "Super Predators" — young criminals who are totally merciless ... capable of committing the most vicious of acts for the most trivial reasons: a pair of sneakers A football jersey. A misplaced glance mistaken for disrespect.
Teenagers who commit violent crimes should be prosecuted as adults and should receive sentences commensurate to the danger they represent to society.
And, as New Hampshire knew more than 200 years ago, we must find hope in the genius of the states. We will find in this body, and in others like it across America, our greatest hope for reforming welfare, fixing our schools and protecting our people from crime. In fact, all our hopes are united by one conviction: that we must return power to where it comes from and where it belongs: to families and communities, to states and to citizens.
But America today is a society in which law-abiding citizens feel increasingly at risk. You know the figures. Each and every year), some 43 million Americans are victims of crime. Some 11 million Americans are victims of violent crime.

Americans feel threatened by random incidents of violent crime. Bob Dole recognizes that many schools that once were passports to opportunity have become demoralizing, fear-ridden places.
Bob Dole has fought for the toughest drug laws in our history: no parole for violent offenders, mandatory sentences for those convicted of crimes using a gun, and the appointment of conservative judges that will end liberal judicial policy. Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce to you a genuine American hero, Bob Dole of Kansas.
Those of us in the political world talk a lot about fighting crime. But you're on the front lines every day, safeguarding our communities and protecting our streets. I salute each and every one of you, and I know everybody here salutes all these fine people all over America who lay their lives on the line every day.
Most Americans need little convincing that we have a crime problem of very serious dimensions in this country. When people say our country is headed in the wrong direction, one of the first things they cite is the explosion of crime. And I've seen America come through some tough challenges in my lifetime, and we have a few more challenges ahead. And I am hopeful because I know that whatever the problems we face, Americans will have what it takes to resolve them.
But I think there is a general feeling that in our criminal justice system, something has gone terribly wrong. We all know the problems. More than 43 million of our fellow citizens are victims of crime each year.
Eleven million of these are violent. But only one in 100 violent crimes ends up in a jail sentence. Yet, when criminals are caught by police and brought to trial, they may never do time.
Our two parties have embraced two different visions of crime and punishment. Until fairly recently, the debate in America was how to catch and punish wrongdoers, not whether to punish them, or whether they were even wrongdoers.
The liberal view is that crime and violence are not so much punishable offenses as treatable disorders. But the liberal philosophy is not the solution to our crime problem. In fact, it's part of the problem.
And Bill Clinton's legacy is already clear. It includes a startling number of appointees more faithful to the liberal orthodoxy than to the traditional notions of crime and punishment.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, last week we learned about another disgrace. We found out that one of the president's top political adviser also helped an accused rapist beat the rap. The same p.r. consultant who has been helping Bill Clinton pose as a crime fighter has been moonlighting for an accused rapist in Connecticut, advising the rapist's legal team on techniques for selecting an easy going jury.
Now the truth is, if Bill Clinton had done more to fight crime, if he had appointed people serious about fighting crime, he wouldn't need a high-priced p.r. man to help him with the issue.
The single most important thing a president can do to fight crime is to put crime fighters in our courtrooms, both on the bench and at the prosecutor's table. And when I am the president that is exactly what I will do.
Now last year, the president proudly announced a slight one-year drop in the violent crime rate. In 1994, more than 23,000 people were murdered, a decline of five percent. And this was proof, he said, that America was moving in the right direction.
And ours is the age of violence without feeling, feeling guilt, and without remorse — the paroled child molester, the drive-by shooting, the thrill shooting, wilding, the serial killer, the mail bomber. And women in America know better than anyone about the randomness and ruthlessness of crime.
The sheriff just told me about the rising rate of juvenile crime. The murder rate among 14-to 17-year-olds more than doubled, rising 172 percent between 1985 and 1994.
Thirty-five percent of all violent crime is now committed by offenders less than 20 years of age. And I think you told me that 18.
Rebuilding the family is the best juvenile crime prevention program we could hope for, and we can start by reforming welfare. And last week I announced...
The good news from our perspective when we deal with these voters and our goals in this convention, is that the issue agenda that we need to get their attention has been an historical Republican issue agenda. It's economics, it's taxes, it's welfare reform, it's crime and drugs.
We think platform week, however, will be more an opportunity for us to talk about some of the bigger issues. And those bigger issues include the problem with crimes and the problem with drug increases in the schools and the problem of over-taxation and over-regulation. And we're going to use platform week to talk about those issues as opposed to focus on simply one or two of the things.
But what we've determined is that the issue agenda that women care about are the exact issues that are Republican issues that we're going to be talking about. They're very concerned about crime. They're very concerned about the quality of their education.
The document states that under Bill Clinton's tenure, violent crime has turned American homes into prisons and streets and schoolyards into battlegrounds. Recognizing that while the federal governments role is essential, law enforcement must remain in the hands Of local communities, directed by state and local officials. The Platform encourages:
To combat surging juvenile crime, the Platform promises to stress accountability at every step in the system and require adult trials for Juveniles who commit adult crimes. The Platform also recognizes the forgotten rights of victims by proposing a Constitutional amendment to protect victim"s rights.
We look at drugs, look at crime, look at opportunities for children. If we want to restrain the use of drugs, if we want to restrain out-of-wedlock births, if we want to get a handle on crime, let's give our children a good education. And that, as I said earlier, is part of this program.
If we want to stop crime and stop drugs, and stop out-of-wedlock births, we give kids a good education. Yes. Children of low income Americans get a good education, and we're going to do that.
What we have in the opinions of millions of Americans is crime and drugs, illegitimacy, abortion, the abdication of duty, and the abandonment of children.
And if we want to reduce crime -- if we want to reduce crime and drug use and teen pregnancies, let's start by giving all our children a first-class education.

Bob Dole is going to appoint judges who'll be tough on crime, tough on crime, as strict constructionists.
We want one clear message that echoes across America from the schoolhouse to the White House, and that is that drug use or drug abuse is wrong. And we're going to add to that in our administration. The judges we will appoint will be tough on crime. They're going to worry about the victims instead of the criminals.
The best way to start cutting out crime and teen pregnancy and drugs is to give that child a good education — give that child a good education.
If we're going to get a handle on crime, teen pregnancy, drugs, all these things that threaten young people, we'd better take a look at education. We'd better break this hammer lock the unions and the bureaucrats have on education and give the schools...
And this, to me, is very, very significant. If we want to get a handle on drugs or crime or all the other things that plague young people, we better make certain they get a good education, starting with kindergarten, starting with kindergarten.
