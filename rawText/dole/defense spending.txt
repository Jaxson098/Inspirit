And because of Senator Thurmond's leadership, we added about what, six billion to defense spending this year. After President Clinton or candidate Clinton campaigned in 1992, said he was going to cut 60 billion out of defense, he cut 127 billion out of defense. And the last time I looked, there were a lot of problems around the world, and we're not looking for trouble, but we do have certain responsibilities and we want to be prepared.
Now that's a big, big wish. But as long as we stay strong, and I've said many, many times, if I make a mistake on defense spending, I'm going to err on the side of spending a little too much, than a little too little.
And I think President Clinton has gone too far. He's talked about cutting defense spending $60 billion, then he cut defense spending $127 billion.
