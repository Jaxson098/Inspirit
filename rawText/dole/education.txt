And yet at the same time, even though they believe that life no longer will be better for their children and that maybe this is as good as it gets, even though they're very unhappy with their safety in their neighborhoods and the quality of education that their children are getting, they still wished that life would be better. So there was still that spark of optimism, or hope rather, even though the feeling was the dream was quickly fading.
But what we've determined is that the issue agenda that women care about are the exact issues that are Republican issues that we're going to be talking about. They're very concerned about crime. They're very concerned about the quality of their education.
The Republican Platform's goal is nothing less than a renaissance in American education, beginning with a return of control to Parents, teachers, and local school boards and, through them, to communities and local taxpayers. The Republican party supports for.
Policies to make parental choice among public, private and religious schools and reality for all Parents. These include charter schools and opportunity scholarships which provide access to a quality education for all Americans.
Continuing to recognize that education should be a local-not federal-concern, the Platform calls for:
Opposition to outcome- or performance-based education in our nation's schools.
It means you will have a president who will expand individual retirement accounts, repeal President Clinton's Social Security tax increase, provide estate tax relief, reduce government regulations, reform our civil justice system, provide educational opportunity scholarships and a host of other proposals that will create more opportunity for all Americans and all across America.
Not for the nothing are we the biggest education spenders and among the lowest education achievers among the leading industrial nations.
And I say this -- I say this not to the teachers, but to their unions. I say this, if education were a war, you would be losing it. If it were a business, you would be driving it into bankruptcy. If it were a patient, it would be dying.
All this for low and middle income families so that you will join the rest of us in accountability, while others compete with you for the commendable privilege of giving our children a real education.
And if we want to reduce crime -- if we want to reduce crime and drug use and teen pregnancies, let's start by giving all our children a first-class education.
If we're going to get a handle on crime, teen pregnancy, drugs, all these things that threaten young people, we'd better take a look at education. We'd better break this hammer lock the unions and the bureaucrats have on education and give the schools...
Many of us, myself included, probably stand here today because after our service in the armed forces we had an education called the GI Bill of Rights. And they didn't tell us where to go to school, they gave us the money and we decided where to go to school. We could go to public school or private school or religious school, whatever. And it ought to be that way with opportunity scholarships. I'm a product of public schools, I'm not trying to threaten public schools. I want competition, I want choice and that all the schools are going to be better.
Low-income parents — I say to low-income parents in Ohio and across America and low-middle-income parents — you know, the presidents sends his daughter to private school. I don't fault that. I applaud that. He wants his daughter to have the best education.
We want to give low-income parents and middle-income parents a choice, the same choice the president, has who sends his daughter to a private school. And I applaud him for it. He wants the best education possible.
And we're going to have a better education. We're going to give people choices. We're going to give the schools back to the parents and back to the teachers, back to the parents and back to the teachers.
Take education out of the hands of the labor bosses in Washington, D.C. — back to the parents, back to the teachers. Give parents choice.
This same philosophy also should be applied to your most awesome responsibility: educating your cities' children. Our public schools were once the source of hope and opportunity. Too often today they have become dangerous and demoralizing places. I have proposed abolishing the Department of Education and sending the money to parents and communities and school districts. And to give parents even more control, we should establish education vouchers so they can choose the best school for their child.
If one of the most important missions of our schools is to make citizens of our children, and I believe that it is, fluency in English should be a central educational goal of every state in our Nation. English is the language in which we still speak to each other across the frontiers of culture and race. It is the language of the Constitution. It is the language in which we conduct our great national debates — an essential ingredient of democracy. Insisting that all our citizens are fluent in English is a welcoming act of inclusion, and insist on it we must.
Yes, schools should provide the language classes our immigrants and their families need, as long as their purpose is the teaching of English. We have done this since our founding to speed the melting of our melting pot. But we must stop the practice of multi-lingual education as a means of instilling ethnic pride, or as a therapy for low self-esteem or out of elitist guilt over a culture built on the traditions of the West. With all the divisive forces tearing at our country, we need the glue of language to help hold us together. If we want to ensure that all our children have the same opportunities in life, alternative language education should stop and English should be acknowledged once and for all as the official language of the United States.
These scores are discouraging. And we must ask ourselves, after the billions of dollars we have poured into education, how can this be? We must answer with the truth, which is that a liberal education bureaucracy has hijacked our schools, using them to pass on liberal ideas we either don't share or don't think should get in the way of reading, writing and arithmetic.
One recent education fad is called "outcome-based education," Unfortunately, too often the outcomes that count are not facts learned, but attitudes achieved. "Willingness to cooperate" and "appreciation of diversity" are two such attitudes. According to some, to correct a kid's spelling risks dampening his "self-esteem", so we should let him be "creative", although wrong, instead, But in America, mastery of the language is a key to success.
That's why I believe our educational reforms start with this simple principle: we want our kids to speak English, to read English and to able to spell in proper, American English.
And at its best, government can help families, and its worst it can hurt families — whether by taxing them too much or failing to deliver a quality education.
And yet at the same time, even though they believe that life no longer will be better for their children and that maybe this is as good as it gets, even though they're very unhappy with their safety in their neighborhoods and the quality of education that their children are getting, they still wished that life would be better. So there was still that spark of optimism, or hope rather, even though the feeling was the dream was quickly fading.

Continuing to recognize that education should be a local-not federal-concern, the Platform calls for:
Opposition to outcome- or performance-based education in our nation's schools.
It seems to me if it's good enough for some who are in positions of power or prestige, it ought to be good enough for everybody in America, because education is the most important thing you can give your child. And we're going to see that it happens. And we have Governor Wilson's support in California. And we have the support of governors — Republicans and Democrats — pretty much across the country. And we believe it's important.
We look at drugs, look at crime, look at opportunities for children. If we want to restrain the use of drugs, if we want to restrain out-of-wedlock births, if we want to get a handle on crime, let's give our children a good education. And that, as I said earlier, is part of this program.
We're going to go to low income parents and lower-middle income parents in New York and across America and say that your kids are entitled to a good education in America.
If we want to stop crime and stop drugs, and stop out-of-wedlock births, we give kids a good education. Yes. Children of low income Americans get a good education, and we're going to do that.
It means you will have a president who will expand individual retirement accounts, repeal President Clinton's Social Security tax increase, provide estate tax relief, reduce government regulations, reform our civil justice system, provide educational opportunity scholarships and a host of other proposals that will create more opportunity for all Americans and all across America.
Not for the nothing are we the biggest education spenders and among the lowest education achievers among the leading industrial nations.
And I say this -- I say this not to the teachers, but to their unions. I say this, if education were a war, you would be losing it. If it were a business, you would be driving it into bankruptcy. If it were a patient, it would be dying.
All this for low and middle income families so that you will join the rest of us in accountability, while others compete with you for the commendable privilege of giving our children a real education.
And if we want to reduce crime -- if we want to reduce crime and drug use and teen pregnancies, let's start by giving all our children a first-class education.
And, certainly, we want to make sure that every young person gets a great education and that you're able to go as far as your skills and talents will take you well prepared. And that's why I'm very proud that Bob wants to offer those opportunity scholarships so that lower- income and middle-income parents will have the same opportunities that wealthy parents have today to choose the school that's best for their child which...
And that school may be outside their district or it may be a private school or it may be a religious school, but everyone should have the opportunity for the best education that can be provided.
The best way to start cutting out crime and teen pregnancy and drugs is to give that child a good education — give that child a good education.
He says school uniforms are a good idea. They probably are a good idea. But the thing the president can't do is reform the educational system because it is controlled by the National Education Association and they will not let him do anything.
If we're going to get a handle on crime, teen pregnancy, drugs, all these things that threaten young people, we'd better take a look at education. We'd better break this hammer lock the unions and the bureaucrats have on education and give the schools...
Many of us, myself included, probably stand here today because after our service in the armed forces we had an education called the GI Bill of Rights. And they didn't tell us where to go to school, they gave us the money and we decided where to go to school. We could go to public school or private school or religious school, whatever. And it ought to be that way with opportunity scholarships. I'm a product of public schools, I'm not trying to threaten public schools. I want competition, I want choice and that all the schools are going to be better.
But let me mention one other thing, because you mentioned children. We also have in our economic package an educational item called Opportunity Scholarships.
Opportunity Scholarships, which will be directed to low-income parents and low middle-income parents who have the same right as anybody with power or prestige or money to get the best education possible for their children. And so we will provide up to $500 K through eight, $750 in high school, and the state will match that. We'll give that money to the parents, not to the school, but to the parents, and they will then pick out the school of their choice.
And this, to me, is very, very significant. If we want to get a handle on drugs or crime or all the other things that plague young people, we better make certain they get a good education, starting with kindergarten, starting with kindergarten.
He'll say that he wants to shrink government, but it's ballooned every year he's been president of the United States. He'll say we need to improve education but then deny you the opportunity to send your children to the school of your choice the way he does.
And here in Ohio, just as in the rest of the parts of the country, people care about the quality of our schools. And that's why we're talking as part of our economic package, we're talking about something called opportunities scholarships. I like teachers. I like public schools. But we're looking at low income American families and low middle income families. A lot of them live in the inner cities and we're going to say to them, we're going to give you an opportunity scholarship because we want to stop drugs and crime and everything else that tempts teenagers. We're going to start with an education, starting in kindergarten, all the way through high school. And we're going to have opportunity scholarships.
And I don't fault President Clinton or Vice President Gore for sending their children to private schools instead of public schools — the public schools are right there — because they want the best education possible for their children. But why shouldn't it be available to every other American, rich or poor, in America?
If we're going to stop crime and drugs and all the other things that happen with teenagers, they've got to have a good education. And it's got to start in kindergarten. And we're going to make certain it happens in a Dole-Kemp administration.
But we're looking at a program particularly for the inner cities — education for kids starting in kindergarten and through high school.
Now if we're gong to stop drugs and crime and all the other things that tempt young people, we've got to provide an education. So we're working on what we call our [audio gap] scholarships.
We put up so much money, the states so much money. It goes to low-income parents or low-middle-income parents. They take that money. They go to a better public school or stay where they are. They're happy, they don't get the scholarship. They want a better public school, private school or religious school, because we want that child to get an education.
And I think, finally to end this on a positive note, we must bring quality education to every child and every community. And I believe the surest route to economic mobility for all Americans lies in the access to a good school.
They want their child to have the best possible education in America. It's not possible.
And why don't they make it through the system? And why do we have one out of four high school graduates who are functionally illiterate? And why has remedial reading become a big, big college course? And why do people graduate from high school who can't find places on the map around the world? Because there's no competition in education and there's no choice.
But President Clinton, President Clinton opposes the most modest educational choice proposals. In fact, he sentences thousands of our poor and minority children to failed and dangerous schools.
And why do I believe that? I'm one, and I'm certain there are others in the audience who served in Vietnam or Korea or World War II. When we finished service, we had an educational opportunity called the GI Bill. They didn't say we had to go to a certain school, they gave us the money.
And the argument after World War II, oh, this is going to, I mean everybody's going to go to private colleges. That didn't happen. It brought about competition. It made education and higher learning more competitive.
And millions and millions of Americans, young men and women, have gotten out of the service, have gotten an education.
It will work if we start at kindergarten right through grade 12. It will work. It will stop some of the crime and some of the drugs and some of the teen — give a child an education in America, Mr. President, give the child an education. Give a child an opportunity.
If you want to get a handle on drugs and crime and teen pregnancy and all the other things, start with an education in kindergarten all the way through high school and all the way through college.
These are called opportunity scholarships, part of our economic plan. And it occurred to me, as a recipient of an opportunity scholarship after World War II — and I had a chance to go to college which I would not have had without that assistance from the government — that education is fundamental. It's basic. It's the most important thing we can do for young people.
They're concerned about drugs and crime and education. But their money is taken out of their check and put into the Clinton campaign. That's what's happening.
If one of the most important missions of our schools is to make citizens of our children, and I believe that it is, fluency in English should be a central educational goal of every state in our Nation. English is the language in which we still speak to each other across the frontiers of culture and race. It is the language of the Constitution. It is the language in which we conduct our great national debates — an essential ingredient of democracy. Insisting that all our citizens are fluent in English is a welcoming act of inclusion, and insist on it we must.

If we want to ensure that all our children have the same opportunities in life, alternative language education should stop and English should be acknowledged once and for all as the official language of the United States.
And that's what this is all about in this year of 1996. It's about you. It's about your business. It's about jobs. It's about opportunities, about taxes, about your families, your children, and education, and all the things you're concerned about in this great state of Michigan.
It means you will have a president who will expand individual retirement accounts, repeal President Clinton's Social Security tax increase, provide estate tax relief, reduce government regulations, reform our civil justice system, provide educational opportunity scholarships and a host of other proposals that will create more opportunity for all Americans and all across America.
Not for the nothing are we the biggest education spenders and among the lowest education achievers among the leading industrial nations.

The Truth: Bill Clinton claims that his targeted tax cut is paid for, "line by line, dime by dime," and one of the ways he "pays" for his $1500 education tax credit is selling a portion of the spectrum. However, Clinton pledged that same portion of the spectrum to pay for increased spending for general education, the environment and technology in his FY 97 budget. (US News and World Report, 10/14/96)
The Truth: Clinton and congressional Democrats cut the maximum Pell Grant by $100. (Education Finance Council) Additionally, Clinton's fist three budget proposals included proposals that would have wrecked higher education. They included proposals that would have cut college work study by $90 million, cut student supplemental opportunity grants by $85 million, cut State Student Incentive Grants by $73 million, and eliminate "Perkins" Student Loans and Guaranteed Student Loans altogether. (Education Finance Council)
And values like trusting parents — and some are behind me here — to choose the best education for the children and help [audio gap] ...it easier for them to make a choice. We need choice and competition in education to make it better, give more children all over America better opportunities.
The real decisions in education should not be in the hands of union bosses and bureaucrats. We've got to give the schools back to the parents and back to the teachers and we'll be a lot better off.
We want to give low-income parents and middle-income parents a choice, the same choice the president, has who sends his daughter to a private school. And I applaud him for it. He wants the best education possible.
And I believe we ought to have choice and competition in education. Give education back to the teachers and back to the parents.
If you don't learn English in America, you're going to be left behind. It's not fair to some one not to learn English. And I will continue to support bilingual education if the purpose is to learn English. Otherwise you're going to be lost in America.
If you want to get a handle on drugs and crime and teen pregnancy and all the other things, start with an education in kindergarten all the way through high school and all the way through college.

And to give parents even more control, we should establish education vouchers so they can choose the best school for their child.
Across our country, parents and teachers, small businesses and farm families, cities and states are beginning to throw off the shackles of big government, to reject the mandates of the liberal elites who have pulled our country so far in the wrong direction. President Clinton has noticed this prairie fire, and has tried to join it. He gave a series of speeches this summer to outline his thinking. But this is his prescription for America: More affirmative action. No change in school prayer. Don't send welfare to the states. Nationalize health care. Politicize Medicare. Federalize education. Rig the results of our markets. And whatever you do, he says, don't criticize the government.
If one of the most important missions of our schools is to make citizens of our children, and I believe that it is, fluency in English should be a central educational goal of every state in our Nation. English is the language in which we still speak to each other across the frontiers of culture and race. It is the language of the Constitution.

And we all know, it would be a different Bill Clinton if he were somehow to win re-election. His liberalism unrestrained by the need to face American people again, instead of trying to pre-empt the Republican initiatives, he will do what comes naturally — raising your taxes again, blocking education reform, imposing more social experiments on our military, mandating more regulations, appointing more permissive judges, and the rest of his sorry grab bag of liberal policies.
And at its best, government can help families, and its worst it can hurt families — whether by taxing them too much or failing to deliver a quality education.
And that's what this is all about in this year of 1996. It's about you. It's about your business. It's about jobs. It's about opportunities, about taxes, about your families, your children, and education, and all the things you're concerned about in this great state of Michigan.
Now, Brother, I want to thank you so much for your very gracious hospitality. All of us are honored to have the opportunity today to hear a major message on education from our choice for the presidency of the United States.
Senator, we in Minnesota pride ourselves on being on the cutting edge of educational reform. Traditionally, Minnesota tends to be at the top of the states in terms of high school graduation rates, percentage of students going on to higher education and in terms of test scores of college bound students.
Now, these were positive changes and they produced positive results. Now, as a state, we could rest on those laurels. But we chose not to. We chose, instead, to look at the job realities of tomorrow and to upgrade the requirements for high school graduation. we decided to test not only college bound students but also those that not anticipating on to higher education. And frankly, the results were alarming.
My parents migrated to the United States from Sweden. They were poor. And as a family, we lived in the Bronx of New York City. But they understood what opportunity was all about. And they understood that education was at the heart of opportunity. And when I was given a scholarship to a private school, it let me know, a kid from the Bronx, what opportunity was all about.
But the airways clearly under our law are designed to promote the public interest. I can't imagine anything we could do that would better promote it than to put more quality educational programming for children on television. So I'd like to ask all of you to support that. And I hope very much that the Federal Communication Commission will finally act on it. ...
The scores keep falling, as Arne said. The dropout rates keep rising, as the governor said. The education bureaucracy keeps getting bigger and bigger. And in many of our cities, public schools are danger zones. And worst of all, the people in charge of running the schools seem to grow more complacent as their vise like monopoly over the schools gets tighter and tighter.
No other nation spends as much on education as we do in United States. Yet, over our public schools hangs an air of failure, frustration and futility. And what makes this so tragic, is that once not so long ago, America's public schools were places of learning and order. They were a model to the world where kids of all classes and all races and all creeds were brought together. And for many of us, a quality education at public school was a first big break we had.
And every parent who gets involved as work against the odds in the system that too often stifles free choice and disregards parental authority. And no one has spoken more fervently about saving our schools than Bill Clinton did back in 1992 when he came to Minnesota and all around the country as candidate. Yet his years in office have been the low point in American public education.
This is our dividend on billions and billions of dollars invested in education: lower test scores, a higher dropout rate, massive remedial education, and an illiteracy rate growing by leaps and bounds.
That's why I have decided to make education an essential part of my pro-growth economic plan. We're talking about it here today. We'll be talking about it tomorrow in Milwaukee. We'll be talking about it again Cleveland on Friday.
Because as I view it, and as I see it, as we get the economy ready for the next century, education ranks right up there with tax reform and regulatory reform and all the other priorities we ought to have in American.
And at the center that afflicts our school is a denial of free choice. Our public schools are in trouble because too often they are no longer run by the public. Instead they are controlled by narrow special interest groups who regard public education not as a public trust, but as political territory to be guarded at all costs, not the public trust.
So he's for reform of education, but I would say this to him. You cannot reform our schools, Mr. President, and at the same time reap generous campaign contributions from the very groups who have run our public schools into the ground. You can't do both.
You cannot be a leader in education, and at the same time be the pliant pet of militant teachers unions who are fighting reform.
Under this administration, only the producers of education have a voice. We're always hearing from the unions and bureaucrats with their armies of lawyers and lobbyists, but who speaks for the consumers? Who speaks for the parents? They don't have political action committees like those who bankroll the Clinton campaign. They can't afford to cut big checks for candidates who do their biding. But they are the ones — yes, they are the ones who help pay more than $250 billion dollars every year to support our public schools. They are the consumers. They are the consumers.
So, I say that public school parents deserve what I call an education consumers warranty — education consumers warranty. A set of assurances that they receive in exchange for contributing their hard earned money and entrusting their children, their children into the care of the public school system. And if I am elected president of the United States, and I will be, here are some of the basic principles that will guide every education policy.
These principles will guide every education policy I pursue and every education dollar we invest. It starts with the principle that every student has a right to be safe in school. Every student has a right to be safe in school, that's number one.
And in my view, and I know the secretaries are experts on this, it's just staggering to hear some of our education experts today object to basic standards of discipline in the name of children's rights. You can't do it because it offends their rights.
Now, phonics isn't fancy or intricate, but it works and has for hundreds of years. But along came our modern education experts and suddenly phonics is being discarded. In its place we have something called the whole language method. It's very interesting. It's very sophisticated, very new and exciting. The only problem is it doesn't work.
Our public schools today are suffering from a generations worth of bad ideas that have little or nothing to do with giving kids a decent education. Even worse, these fads have been unwritten by the taxpayers and you are the taxpayers.
You are underwriting this f-a-i-l-u-r-e, failure, failure, failure. And I hope and I believe I speak for mothers, fathers and students across America when I say to the education establishment if you want more tax money, start putting the money where we can give it to a better use, help our children's self-esteem by giving him something to be proud of. Work with us and not against us to prepare our-children.
Work with us and not against us to prepare our children for lives of achievement and good citizenship. Let's drop all of politically correct nonsense and give our kids a decent education, a descent education.
To bring a little life and competition and freedom into the Washington school system. But the national education association said, no.
First we have to have voters choice. See what the voters think about Bill Clinton's education record come the 5th of November. And before the age of big government, the public school system, as I said earlier, was based on freedom and common sense. On a belief in standards and ability that children to meet the standards. And perhaps above all, on trusting parents who do the right thing for their children.
And it can work again with such innovations as competency testing for teachers and an education consumers warranty that outlines what all American families should expect from the system: a safe school, the ability to learn the three R's through proven methods and to acquire an understanding of American history and our democratic values, freedom from needless bureaucracy and red tape, the right to know whether the meet is meetings its obligations, a diploma that signifies readiness for college or a job and the ability to choose the school that's right for them.
When I am president of the United States, the education consumers, you the parents, and the consumers warranty will be guarded by leaders who know the territory.
So when we talk about education reform, let's remember it doesn't begin in Washington or the state capital, it begins right in our own kitchen and our own living rooms. And never in human history have children had as many opportunities as our children have today
Preparing our children for those opportunities is not the job of distant bureaucrats or education theorists. It is the job of every parent, son and daughter in America, of free people who take responsibility for themselves and demand that the government reflect their values and common sense.
And yet at the same time, even though they believe that life no longer will be better for their children and that maybe this is as good as it gets, even though they're very unhappy with their safety in their neighborhoods and the quality of education that their children are getting, they still wished that life would be better. So there was still that spark of optimism, or hope rather, even though the feeling was the dream was quickly fading.
But what we've determined is that the issue agenda that women care about are the exact issues that are Republican issues that we're going to be talking about. They're very concerned about crime. They're very concerned about the quality of their education.
The Republican Platform's goal is nothing less than a renaissance in American education, beginning with a return of control to Parents, teachers, and local school boards and, through them, to communities and local taxpayers. The Republican party supports for.
Policies to make parental choice among public, private and religious schools and reality for all Parents. These include charter schools and opportunity scholarships which provide access to a quality education for all Americans.
Continuing to recognize that education should be a local-not federal-concern, the Platform calls for:
Opposition to outcome- or performance-based education in our nation's schools.
And we'll move education out of hands of bureaucrats and unions and into the hands of the parents where it belongs in the first place and where it ought to stay.
It seems to me if it's good enough for some who are in positions of power or prestige, it ought to be good enough for everybody in America, because education is the most important thing you can give your child. And we're going to see that it happens. And we have Governor Wilson's support in California. And we have the support of governors — Republicans and Democrats — pretty much across the country. And we believe it's important.
We look at drugs, look at crime, look at opportunities for children. If we want to restrain the use of drugs, if we want to restrain out-of-wedlock births, if we want to get a handle on crime, let's give our children a good education. And that, as I said earlier, is part of this program.
We're going to go to low income parents and lower-middle income parents in New York and across America and say that your kids are entitled to a good education in America.
If we want to stop crime and stop drugs, and stop out-of-wedlock births, we give kids a good education. Yes. Children of low income Americans get a good education, and we're going to do that.
And certainly Bob has known the struggle to make ends meet. In fact, he couldn't have had a college education if it were not for the GI Bill. And so, he's going to protect and preserve and strengthen that safety net for those who need it.
It means you will have a president who will expand individual retirement accounts, repeal President Clinton's Social Security tax increase, provide estate tax relief, reduce government regulations, reform our civil justice system, provide educational opportunity scholarships and a host of other proposals that will create more opportunity for all Americans and all across America.
Not for the nothing are we the biggest education spenders and among the lowest education achievers among the leading industrial nations.
And I say this -- I say this not to the teachers, but to their unions. I say this, if education were a war, you would be losing it. If it were a business, you would be driving it into bankruptcy. If it were a patient, it would be dying.
All this for low and middle income families so that you will join the rest of us in accountability, while others compete with you for the commendable privilege of giving our children a real education.
And if we want to reduce crime -- if we want to reduce crime and drug use and teen pregnancies, let's start by giving all our children a first-class education.
And, certainly, we want to make sure that every young person gets a great education and that you're able to go as far as your skills and talents will take you well prepared. And that's why I'm very proud that Bob wants to offer those opportunity scholarships so that lower- income and middle-income parents will have the same opportunities that wealthy parents have today to choose the school that's best for their child which...
And that school may be outside their district or it may be a private school or it may be a religious school, but everyone should have the opportunity for the best education that can be provided.
The best way to start cutting out crime and teen pregnancy and drugs is to give that child a good education — give that child a good education.
He says school uniforms are a good idea. They probably are a good idea. But the thing the president can't do is reform the educational system because it is controlled by the National Education Association and they will not let him do anything.
1. Washington takeover. The centerpiece of Clinton's education agenda is Goals 2000, a thinly veiled federal power grab of state education authority. One former Department of Education official called Goals 2000 "the worst-received and most-hated federal education program ever." Goals 2000 vests a national school board with approval power over state and local school reform.
2. Federal bureaucracy expands. Clinton pushed through amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that included over 1000 pages of wasteful and politically correct spending, including a "Special Assistant for Gender Equity," barriers to school choice, and federal regulation of sex education programs.
6. English becomes optional. Clinton's Education Department rules that NAEP -- a nation-wide measure of academic progress - must also be administered in Spanish. The Department's widely discredited and heavy-handed federal bilingual education program expands.
12. The world watches. An evaluation of U.S. education by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development concluded that "The performance of the education system at the primary and secondary levels has to be regarded as mediocre."
Many of the issues on which the NEA lobbies are traditional ultra-liberal agenda items that have nothing to do with education. Among them:
"By drawing education into the political discourse, Bill Clinton has drawn a clear distinction between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton. Bob Dole trusts the people. Bill Clinton trusts the NEA."
And Governor, I thank you and Mayor, I thank you for being here. And Lamar has been with me on the road. Howard Baker has been out with me on the road. Secretary Bennett — I've got two former secretaries of education. I really feel smart today to have both of those guys up here with me.
We also want to put parents back in control of their children's education.
And that's what opportunity scholarships are all about. Put the parents and teachers back in control of education.
This is not about parents versus teachers because most of them are on the same side. It's about teachers unions controlled from Washington, D.C. who have a hammer lock on the education system. Put it back where it belongs.
If we're going to get a handle on crime, teen pregnancy, drugs, all these things that threaten young people, we'd better take a look at education. We'd better break this hammer lock the unions and the bureaucrats have on education and give the schools...
Many of us, myself included, probably stand here today because after our service in the armed forces we had an education called the GI Bill of Rights. And they didn't tell us where to go to school, they gave us the money and we decided where to go to school. We could go to public school or private school or religious school, whatever. And it ought to be that way with opportunity scholarships. I'm a product of public schools, I'm not trying to threaten public schools. I want competition, I want choice and that all the schools are going to be better.
To escape Bill Clinton's high-tax, low-wage economy, Dole and Kemp outline the major elements of their plan: a Balanced Budget Amendment, a balanced budget by the year 2002, tax relief and fundamental tax reform, ending, the IRS as we know it, education and job training reform, and regulatory and lawsuit reform. The book describes the impact of Dole, and Kemp's proposed 15% across-the-board tax cut, the $ 500-per-child tax credit, the reduction in the capital gains tax, repeal of Bill Clinton's Social Security benefits tax, the expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts, and their education and job training incentives.
Unfortunately, the growing problem of illegal immigration is undermining our nation's social fabric. The current flood of illegal immigrants is swamping our health and educational systems, draining the tax revenues of state and local governments, and imposing new burdens on the law-abiding public. Father Theodore Hesburgh, former President of Notre Dame University, was right when he warned that we must close the back door of illegal immigration, so we can keep open the front door of legal immigration.
California's children find themselves with 58,000 fewer teachers and one million fewer classroom computers so illegal immigrants can use California's educational system without charge. Providing educational services to illegal immigrants costs the State of California more, than $ 2 billion annually.
To enhance Proposition 187's prospects in court and to ensure its ultimate implementation, I support the "Gallegly amendment," a provision of the illegal immigration reform bill that would allow each state to set its own public education policies towards illegal immigrants. Without the Gallegly amendment, each state will be powerless to set its own educational priorities and will continue to be forced to cover the costs of the federal mandate created by the Supreme Court's Plyler v. Doe derision.
The nine task forces will focus on economic growth with Chair Gary Becker; tax reduction and reform with Chair Michael Boskin; budget and spending controls with Chair John Cogan; regulation reform with Chair Wendy Gramm; litigation reform with Chair John Robson; privatization and decentralization with Chair Walter Wriston; education, training and out-placement with Chair Peter Flanigan, international trade and investment with Chair Carla Hills; and implementation of Bob Dole's Plan for Economic Renewal with Chair Edwin Meese. The chairs of each task force will also serve on the Advisory Committee.
But let me mention one other thing, because you mentioned children. We also have in our economic package an educational item called Opportunity Scholarships.
Opportunity Scholarships, which will be directed to low-income parents and low middle-income parents who have the same right as anybody with power or prestige or money to get the best education possible for their children. And so we will provide up to $500 K through eight, $750 in high school, and the state will match that. We'll give that money to the parents, not to the school, but to the parents, and they will then pick out the school of their choice.
And this, to me, is very, very significant. If we want to get a handle on drugs or crime or all the other things that plague young people, we better make certain they get a good education, starting with kindergarten, starting with kindergarten.
"An improvement in economic growth requires that we cut taxes and control spending, reduce regulation, and encourage saving, investment, and education to build a more productive economy for our future. This is what the Dole-Kemp economic program is designed to do."
He has persistently supported the trial lawyers and their frivolous law suits, while opposing reform of our legal system. He has kept faith with the national teachers union leaders and opposed giving parents more control over their children's education.
Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole will visit Atlanta, Georgia on Thursday, October 3, 1996. He will attend a Dole,/ Kemp'96 Rally from 4:00pm to 5:00pm EDT. Media attending should be prepared to provide local or national media credentials with photo education. All times are local.
He'll say that he wants to shrink government, but it's ballooned every year he's been president of the United States. He'll say we need to improve education but then deny you the opportunity to send your children to the school of your choice the way he does.
* Made at least 20 false claims about Medicare, education, 100,000 cops, Dole's record, and other issues;
Like they did in 1992, Bill Clinton and Al Gore have been promising for months to give voters "targeted" tax cuts if reelected. But the bi-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation found that Clinton's "targeted" cuts are paid for with $188 billion in tax increases -- a net tax increase of $64 billion. Worse yet, the bulk of Bill Clinton's tax "cuts", including his child tax and education tax deduction, are temporary -- they disappear on December 31, 2000.
And here in Ohio, just as in the rest of the parts of the country, people care about the quality of our schools. And that's why we're talking as part of our economic package, we're talking about something called opportunities scholarships. I like teachers. I like public schools. But we're looking at low income American families and low middle income families. A lot of them live in the inner cities and we're going to say to them, we're going to give you an opportunity scholarship because we want to stop drugs and crime and everything else that tempts teenagers. We're going to start with an education, starting in kindergarten, all the way through high school. And we're going to have opportunity scholarships.
And I don't fault President Clinton or Vice President Gore for sending their children to private schools instead of public schools — the public schools are right there — because they want the best education possible for their children. But why shouldn't it be available to every other American, rich or poor, in America?
If we're going to stop crime and drugs and all the other things that happen with teenagers, they've got to have a good education. And it's got to start in kindergarten. And we're going to make certain it happens in a Dole-Kemp administration.
Low-income parents — I say to low-income parents in Ohio and across America and low-middle-income parents — you know, the presidents sends his daughter to private school. I don't fault that. I applaud that. He wants his daughter to have the best education.
But we're looking at a program particularly for the inner cities — education for kids starting in kindergarten and through high school.
Now if we're gong to stop drugs and crime and all the other things that tempt young people, we've got to provide an education. So we're working on what we call our [audio gap] scholarships.
We put up so much money, the states so much money. It goes to low-income parents or low-middle-income parents. They take that money. They go to a better public school or stay where they are. They're happy, they don't get the scholarship. They want a better public school, private school or religious school, because we want that child to get an education.
The Truth: Bill Clinton claims that his targeted tax cut is paid for, "line by line, dime by dime," and one of the ways he "pays" for his $1500 education tax credit is selling a portion of the spectrum. However, Clinton pledged that same portion of the spectrum to pay for increased spending for general education, the environment and technology in his FY 97 budget. (US News and World Report, 10/14/96)
The Truth: Clinton and congressional Democrats cut the maximum Pell Grant by $100. (Education Finance Council) Additionally, Clinton's fist three budget proposals included proposals that would have wrecked higher education. They included proposals that would have cut college work study by $90 million, cut student supplemental opportunity grants by $85 million, cut State Student Incentive Grants by $73 million, and eliminate "Perkins" Student Loans and Guaranteed Student Loans altogether. (Education Finance Council)
And values like trusting parents — and some are behind me here — to choose the best education for the children and help [audio gap] ...it easier for them to make a choice. We need choice and competition in education to make it better, give more children all over America better opportunities.
The real decisions in education should not be in the hands of union bosses and bureaucrats. We've got to give the schools back to the parents and back to the teachers and we'll be a lot better off.
Medicaid ought to come back. Block grants and all these education — some of these education — and training programs ought to come back to the governors. Every opportunity we have. Why? Because it's closer to the people.
And we believe in education reform, which President Clinton can't do anything about. Because, again, the labor bosses, the NEA have got him tied up. He can't do anything.
We give it to the parents, we don't give it to the school. We give it to the parents. They decide which school, maybe another public school, maybe a private school. They want their child to have a good education. And the fact that you're poor shouldn't mean you can't have a good education for your children.
It may be somewhere else. But I want to tell you one final thing on drugs. I know Bill Clinton says, well, this ought to be bipartisan. It's all right for — He'll say, it's all right for me to go out and scare everybody in America on Medicare and on Medicaid and on veterans benefits and on education, even though John Kasich will tell you we're spending more than ever because of a Republican Congress, on grants, and on Pell Grants and on student loans in a Republican administration — Republican Congress.
And I would say about the NEA, since somebody asked me that, I want to go unanswered. I believe in public education. I'm a product, my daughter's a product, my wife's a product of public education. Most everyone here is. So I'm a strong supporter of public education.
And I like teachers, and I want to turn education back to the parents and back to the teachers and take it away from the union bosses.
We want to give low-income parents and middle-income parents a choice, the same choice the president, has who sends his daughter to a private school. And I applaud him for it. He wants the best education possible.
And I believe we ought to have choice and competition in education. Give education back to the teachers and back to the parents.
If you don't learn English in America, you're going to be left behind. It's not fair to some one not to learn English. And I will continue to support bilingual education if the purpose is to learn English. Otherwise you're going to be lost in America.
And I think, finally to end this on a positive note, we must bring quality education to every child and every community. And I believe the surest route to economic mobility for all Americans lies in the access to a good school.
They want their child to have the best possible education in America. It's not possible.
And why don't they make it through the system? And why do we have one out of four high school graduates who are functionally illiterate? And why has remedial reading become a big, big college course? And why do people graduate from high school who can't find places on the map around the world? Because there's no competition in education and there's no choice.
But President Clinton, President Clinton opposes the most modest educational choice proposals. In fact, he sentences thousands of our poor and minority children to failed and dangerous schools.
And why do I believe that? I'm one, and I'm certain there are others in the audience who served in Vietnam or Korea or World War II. When we finished service, we had an educational opportunity called the GI Bill. They didn't say we had to go to a certain school, they gave us the money.
And the argument after World War II, oh, this is going to, I mean everybody's going to go to private colleges. That didn't happen. It brought about competition. It made education and higher learning more competitive.
And millions and millions of Americans, young men and women, have gotten out of the service, have gotten an education.
It will work if we start at kindergarten right through grade 12. It will work. It will stop some of the crime and some of the drugs and some of the teen — give a child an education in America, Mr. President, give the child an education. Give a child an opportunity.
If you want to get a handle on drugs and crime and teen pregnancy and all the other things, start with an education in kindergarten all the way through high school and all the way through college.
These are called opportunity scholarships, part of our economic plan. And it occurred to me, as a recipient of an opportunity scholarship after World War II — and I had a chance to go to college which I would not have had without that assistance from the government — that education is fundamental. It's basic. It's the most important thing we can do for young people.
They're concerned about drugs and crime and education. But their money is taken out of their check and put into the Clinton campaign. That's what's happening.
And we're going to have a better education. We're going to give people choices. We're going to give the schools back to the parents and back to the teachers, back to the parents and back to the teachers.
Take education out of the hands of the labor bosses in Washington, D.C. — back to the parents, back to the teachers. Give parents choice.
Many of the issues on which the NEA lobbies are traditional ultra-liberal agenda items that have nothing to do with education. Among them:
And we're going to have a better education. We're going to give people choices. We're going to give the schools back to the parents and back to the teachers, back to the parents and back to the teachers.
