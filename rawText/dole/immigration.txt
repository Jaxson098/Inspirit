"Steve Forbes has run a one-dimensional, single-issue campaign," Merrill said. "A one-on-one debate would give people a chance to learn that on a wide range of social issues -- from welfare to immigration to abortion to gays in the military -- Steve Forbes' views are much closer to Bill Clinton's than to the average Republican voter."
The iteration plank of the Platform states that ours is "a nation of immigrants" and that "we should welcome those who follow our laws and that a better life. " At the same time, it recognizes that illegal immigration has reached crisis proportions. The Platform addresses the need to curb abuses from illegal immigration by:
Let me speak about immigration. Yes. Let me speak about immigration. The right and obligation of a sovereign nation to control its borders is beyond debate. We should not have here a single illegal immigrant.
But the question of immigration is broader than that, and let me specific. A family from Mexico arrives this morning legally has as much right to the American Dream as the direct descents of the Founding Fathers.
The war was fought just a generation after America's greatest and most intense period of immigration. And yet when the blood of the sons of immigrants and the grandsons of slaves fell on foreign fields, it was American blood. In it you could not read the ethnic particulars of the soldier who died next to you. He was an American.
In fact, he refused to approve an immigration bill and insisted on the removal of a provision prohibiting illegal aliens from earning Social Security benefits. We've got enough trouble with Social Security without having benefits being paid to those who are illegal in this country. If they're legally in this country, all right.
There are a lot of things he's done. Illegal immigration costs the state of California $3 billion a year. You pay it. You pay it.

And then we have all these new people coming into America, rushing through the immigration process. And we find out that maybe as high as 10 percent are criminals. They want to get them ready for Election Day.
He took about $10 billion out of the California economy. Then he cost you about 520,000 jobs. He's ignored the huge cost — and California is different than any state in the nation. It's not that we're not compassionate people. As the governor said, legal immigration is one thing. Illegal immigration is something else. We're a nation of immigrants. We're proud of immigrants. We're proud they're Americans. But where do you draw the line? Where do you close the border?
And I don't think we ought to put the election ahead of the proper naturalization service. I mean when Vice President Gore assigned some of his people and they went over there and played politics, with immigration, that's a big, big mistake. That's an outrage. It's an outrage.
But if you look back over the last 30 years on issue after issue, this state has lead America in thinking about its future. Go back to Ronald Reagan, you provided the turning point to the tax cut revolution in America — all across America — and the critical mass for immigration reform with Prop 187.

The prosperity and freedom of our country, with all its opportunities has made America a magnet for immigration.
Unfortunately, the growing problem of illegal immigration is undermining our nation's social fabric. The current flood of illegal immigrants is swamping our health and educational systems, draining the tax revenues of state and local governments, and imposing new burdens on the law-abiding public. Father Theodore Hesburgh, former President of Notre Dame University, was right when he warned that we must close the back door of illegal immigration, so we can keep open the front door of legal immigration.
The State of California has been particularly hard hit by illegal immigration. Today, California's taxpayers pay billions of dollars for social services for people who legally have no right to be in the Golden State.
In many ways, the wonderful California quality of life is being threatened by the flood of illegal immigration.
To enhance Proposition 187's prospects in court and to ensure its ultimate implementation, I support the "Gallegly amendment," a provision of the illegal immigration reform bill that would allow each state to set its own public education policies towards illegal immigrants. Without the Gallegly amendment, each state will be powerless to set its own educational priorities and will continue to be forced to cover the costs of the federal mandate created by the Supreme Court's Plyler v. Doe derision.
Unfortunately, President Bill Clinton -- urged on by his liberal allies in Congress -- has made clear that he will veto any illegal immigration reform measure if it contains the Gallegly amendment. In this way, the President is standing in the way of the full implementation of Proposition 187.
It is wrong for the liberal Democrats led by a liberal President to deny Americans illegal immigration reform. And it is wrong for them to force the citizens of California to continue to pay billions of dollars for social services for illegal immigrants, when controlling illegal immigration is the federal government's responsibility.
First, separate the Gallegly amendment from the current illegal immigration reform bill. Report the revised illegal immigration reform bill and pass it in the House and Senate. It contains many important provisions that will help reduce illegal immigration. I call on President Clinton to sign the revised bill once it is sent to him.
The Congress should pass the revised illegal immigration reform bill and it should then pass legislation permitting implementation of Proposition 187.
