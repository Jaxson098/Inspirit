And it must be said because of misguided priorities there have been massive cuts in funding for our national security. I believe President Clinton has failed to adequately provide for our defense. And for whatever reason the neglect, it is irresponsible.

The Dole for President campaign today announced that Arizona Senator John McCain has endorsed Senator Bob Dole for President. Having served as national chairman to the former presidential campaign of Phil Gramm, Senator McCain will become the Dole for President Campaign chief advisor on national security issues.
"I am very pleased to endorse my friend, Senator Bob Dole, for President, and I am honored that he has asked me to serve his campaign in the capacity of chief national security advisor. Bob Dole is quite clearly the quality candidate in this race. He has the experience, wisdom and strength to recover for this country's foreign policy the prestige and purpose which has been so badly squandered by the incumbent Administration," said McCain.

Since our country's founding, U.S. agriculture has been a source of economic growth and prosperity at home and a symbol of strength and leadership throughout the world. The importance of a strong, vibrant agricultural sector of our national economy and national security is no less today than it was two centuries ago. Today, over 60 million Americans make their home in rural and small town America, and one in five is employed in an agriculture. Recognizing these facts, we hereby sign "the Dole/Kemp Pledge to Agriculture and Rural America." As President and Vice President of the United States, we will actively carry out the following policies and actions:
* We will not single out agricultural exports in any trade embargo implemented for foreign policy or national security reasons.
