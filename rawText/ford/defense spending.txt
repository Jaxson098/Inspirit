Along with that line, there is a concern now about our current defense stand, our current strength. We spoke a little earlier about the National Guard and the fact that numbers are down--our military budget is the smallest as the percentage of the GNP it has ever been. Many of the people here that have been in the countries prior to World War II skimped on their military, now find themselves in enslaved nations. I wanted your comments on the military budget and the defense spending.
I am particularly gratified to report that over the past 2Â½ years, we have been able to reverse the dangerous decline of the previous decade in real resources this country was devoting to national defense. This was an immediate problem I faced in 1974. The evidence was unmistakable that the Soviet Union had been steadily increasing the resources it applied to building its military strength. During this same period the United States real defense spending declined. In my three budgets we not only arrested that dangerous decline, but we have established the positive trend which is essential to our ability to contribute to peace and stability in the world.
The Vietnam war, both materially and psychologically, affected our overall defense posture. The dangerous anti-military sentiment discouraged defense spending and unfairly disparaged the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces.
You know, the fashion is to deride excessive defense spending. The fact of the matter is that defense outlays have been a dwindling part of our gross national product, falling from 8 to 9 percent in 1969 to less than 6 percent by 1976.
Since I am speaking of defense and the cost for that preparedness, let me say a word about the defense budget. As a result of Congressional actions and inflation, defense spending in 1976--measured in real terms--will be more than onethird below the peak Vietnam war level and about 20 percent below the pre-Vietnam level.
That is why I, as well as you, consider the $92.8 billion in defense spending which has been requested in fiscal year 1976 a basic minimum to assure the security of this Nation in an insecure world.
This is a basic dilemma. When a nation wants to achieve contradictory goals, such as military security and less defense spending, sooner or later citizens must make a choice.
For example, in 1968, defense spending represented about 60 percent of our total Federal Government spending. Today, it is down to about 27 percent.
One such practical demonstration will be the fate of the 1976 defense budget which I proposed to the Congress in January. Because the United States today is at peace, there are some who want to cut back on defense spending and put these dollars into their own pet domestic programs.
The hard fact is that we have consistently done this in recent years, while our potential adversaries have consistently increased their military budgets. In real terms, our defense spending has dropped to its lowest level since before the Korean conflict.
During the Vietnam war, defense spending concentrated--and properly soon current combat requirements, shortchanging our long-range research and development efforts. If our technological lead is not rapidly recovered, this could be fatal to our qualitative superiority in the future. Scientific progress in the Pentagon must be an equal partner with the best in personnel and the best in weapons in maintaining peace and deterring war.

After so many, many years in which America's defensive needs were shortchanged by the Congress, I proposed the two largest defense outlays in America's history. And I convinced the Congress during this last session that they have been playing with fire and that if we were going to keep the peace that we had, that they could not go through the routine that they followed in the past. And they went along with the kind of defense spending that I proposed, the kind that means we not only have security today but we will have it in the years ahead. And let me say, the next Congress, under the Ford-Dole administration, will have to keep the same commitment to the American people.
