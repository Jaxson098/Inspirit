Before we came over I found that when you got your independence 200 years ago, the total population of then the United States was 3 million which is exactly--[laughter]--the population of Israel today. And I found that your growth came as a result of the determination of the Founding Fathers to build a country, but in addition to that, by maintaining the basic principle of open gates to waves of immigrants. And your country grew up by the waves of immigrants that came to this great country. We maintain the same policy. And we have grown through immigration and will continue to grow through immigration.
There are about 71,000 Cuban refugees--35,000 of them in this immediate area--who are technically eligible for permanent resident-alien status, but they must wait too long for their turn under the immigration quota system. I will speed up that process.
I am directing the Attorney General to take all possible administrative actions and, if necessary, to seek additional legislation to assure that Cuban refugees can be awarded permanent resident status without being delayed by the immigration quota system. We are dealing with human lives which have already suffered enough disruption. America will remain true to our heritage as a sanctuary to the oppressed.
How well they built is told by millions upon millions who came and are still coming. Our first national census in 1790 produced a recorded population just under 4 million. Three-fourths of them traced their ancestry to the British Isles, though most had considered themselves American for several generations. There was already talk about further immigration, proposing it should be selective and restrictive, but this was swept aside by the greatest mass movement of people in all human history.
