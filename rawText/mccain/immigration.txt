Immigration reform, a signature issue for you. Here's how The Washington Post reported it. "The co- author of lat year's immigration bill" "John McCain, has been largely absent from this year's negotiations, as he soft-pedals his pro-immigration stance.
On immigration, campaign-finance, global warming and other issues, we have profoundly disagreed with the Arizona senator. But in his 21 years in the Senate, we have seen a leader emerge who is not guided by the polls but who is informed by his critics. That is a rare and valuable combination of experience in any leader.
Trade offers opportunity; aid can help ensure that those opportunities are available to all. The United States should launch a major program designed not to increase handouts but rather to build capacity, improve education, cut red tape, and reduce the corruption that is the foremost impediment to economic growth. We should target assistance and micro-lending to the economically isolated and often indigenous populations among our free trade partners. We need to help governments do these things not only because extreme inequality threatens the future of market democracy, but also because helping Latin America expand growth and opportunity at home is an important element in curbing illegal immigration and expanding American markets.
Mexico must be a vital partner in stopping illegal immigration. President Calderon has shown strong leadership in confronting drug crime throughout his country. By extraditing drug kingpins to the United States, deploying Mexican troops to enforce order in cartel-dominated areas, and by taking on the narcotics trade so directly, he has embarked on a courageous and vital course. The Mexican government must win this war. Should the gangs and cartels prove victorious, our security will be weakened and more drugs will flow into the United States. Mexico needs more help from the United States in this effort, and in a McCain Adminstration, that help will come.
Border state governors have certified and the American people recognize that after tremendous improvements to border security infrastructure and increases in the border patrol, and vigorous prosecution of companies that employ illegal aliens, our southern border is now secure. Illegal immigrants who broke our laws after they came here have been arrested and deported. Illegal immigration has been finally brought under control, and the American people accepted the practical necessity to institute a temporary worker program and deal humanely with the millions of immigrants who have been in this country illegally.
Our compassion for laborers who entered this country unlawfully -- our understanding of their struggles, even as we act to secure the border -- speaks well of America. But this respect does not extend to criminals who came here to break our laws and do harm to people. Through the Criminal Alien Program, we have made some progress in recent years. Too often, however, states are left to deal with the high costs and excessive regulation involved in deportation proceedings, and many local officers are left waiting for immigration agents to show up on site. So, as president, I will expand the Criminal Alien Program. We will require that the federal government assume more of the costs to deport and detain criminal aliens -- because this is a problem of the federal government's own making.

We can do the same on the issue of immigration. I understand the magnitude of the problem. We can do all that is possible to defend our borders from illegal immigration, and affirm the rule of law. When we have made these improvements, we must still recognize that job opportunities here and poverty elsewhere in the world will still attract immigrants desperate to improve their lives, and who will use increasingly desperate measures to do so. We can devise a rational and fair process, which protects our security and affirms America's promise as a land of opportunity.

Surely, I have held other positions that have not met with widespread agreement from conservatives. I won't pretend otherwise nor would you permit me to forget it. On the issue of illegal immigration, a position which provoked the outspoken opposition of many conservatives, I stood my ground aware that my position would imperil my campaign. I respect your opposition for I know that the vast majority of critics to the bill based their opposition in a principled defense of the rule of law. And while I and other Republican supporters of the bill were genuine in our intention to restore control of our borders, we failed, for various and understandable reasons, to convince Americans that we were. I accept that, and have pledged that it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first, and only after we achieved widespread consensus that our borders are secure, would we address other aspects of the problem in a wa y that defends the rule of law and does not encourage another wave of illegal immigration.
So this is not just the illegal immigration problem. It is these -- I mean, these are the -- it's hard to -- the brutality and cruelty practiced by these people in the drug cartels is beyond our imagination.
This Senate maverick has spent years forging coalitions - on campaign finance reform, immigration reform, on judicial nominations - all with the intent of getting things done in the toxically partisan world of Washington.
McCain's biggest challenge is that after eight years of the Bush White House, it's hard to say his party still believes in smaller government. He has run an uneven campaign, facing an unfair share of blame for budget deficits, feeble economic growth, costly military interventions, uncontrolled immigration, emergency bailouts of misled corporations, and a diminished world opinion of America.
Yes, Senator McCain is a hero of the Viet Nam war and has intelligently served his country with honor and integrity. He understands the important issues of the day and has shown valor in spearheading initiatives at great political risk such as immigration reform and limiting the undue influence of money in political campaigns. He is well known for his bipartisan efforts to accomplish legislative goals.
Now, I know how it is on this show. You show various segments and comments that we make thousands of, and I understand that. But the fact is I am not George Bush. The fact is that I was not popular within my own party. The fact is that when I said that we were failing in Iraq and we were going to lose, I was criticized by Republicans. The fact is when I did campaign finance reform with Russ Feingold, I was opposed by my own party and my own president. So do we share a common philosophy of the Republican Party? Of course. But I've, I've stood up against my party, not just President Bush, but others; and I've got the scars to prove it, including taking up, with Ted Kennedy, immigration reform, knowing full well that that was going to hurt my chances in the primaries. So I could go down a long list of issues with you.

"It's quite audacious for Barack Obama to question John McCain's commitment to immigration reform when it was Obama himself who worked to kill the Senate's bipartisan immigration reform compromise last year. Barack Obama voted for five 'poison pill' amendments designed by special interests to kill the immigration reform deal. These efforts were strongly opposed by Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA), the Democrat who led the fight for immigration reform, because he understood they would have the effect of ending the bipartisan work toward immigration reform.
"The reality is that Barack Obama has never reached across the aisle to lead in a bipartisan fashion on an issue of major importance to the American people when his own political interests were at risk. The American people are tired of typical politicians like Barack Obama. While John McCain was reaching across the aisle to solve the tough problem of immigration reform, Barack Obama was working for politics as usual in Washington."
The Weekly Standard's Fred Barnes: "Obama Professes In Speeches And His Bestselling Book, The Audacity Of Hope, To Rise Above Crass Party Interests. Not This Time." "Where was Barack Obama? The moment was perfect last week for the Illinois senator and champion of bipartisanship to step forward and help save the compromise immigration bill from a premature death. All he needed to do was switch his vote to oppose an amendment whose passage was going to shatter the Senate coalition that negotiated the bill. By switching, Obama would have substantiated his claim to be a politician eager to reach across the partisan aisle and end the bitter polarization in Washington. But Obama was not heard from. A day later, with the deliberations on the bill in turmoil, Senate majority leader Harry Reid yanked it off the Senate floor. Obama voted with Reid on cloture, which failed, prompting the shutdown. It may be unfair to single ou t Obama for backing a so-called poison pill that would have weakened the proposed temporary worker program (by terminating it after five years). Obama wasn't alone. Two Democratic presidential candidates--Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden--voted with him, as did Reid, Chuck Schumer, and Dick Durbin, Reid's colleagues in the Senate Democratic leadership. What made Obama's vote different was his hypocrisy. The others are hard-core partisans. Obama professes in speeches and his bestselling book, The Audacity of Hope, to rise above crass party interests. Not this time." (Fred Barnes, "The 'Grand Bargain' Comes Undone," The Weekly Standard, 6/18/07)
Obama "Backed 11th- Hour Amendments" To The Bipartisan Immigration Bill That Imperiled The Immigration Reform Compromise. "Obama was part of the bipartisan group of senators who began meeting in 2005 on comprehensive immigration reform. But last summer, with the presidential nominating race well under way, Obama backed 11th-hour amendments - supported by labor, immigrant rights, and clergy groups - that Republicans saw as imperiling the fragile compromise. None of those measures passed. But Obama was part of a 49-to-48 majority that voted to end after five years a temporary worker program that had been a cornerstone of the immigration deal. The vote, backed by labor, was seen as a major setback to bipartisan negotiations." (Ariel Sabar, "For Obama, Bipartisan Aims, Party-Line Votes," Christian Science Monitor, 4/17/08)
Obama Was Not Heavily Involved In Efforts To Secure Bipartisan Immigration Reform. "He did support the bipartisan effort to get an immigration bill last year, winning a plaudit from McCain. But he didn't work closely with the White House, as did Sen. Edward Kennedy." (David Ignatius, Op-Ed, "Obama: A Thin Record For A Bridge Builder," The Washington Post, 3/2/08)
Let me address one other issue important to all of us. As you know, I and many other colleagues twice attempted to pass comprehensive immigration legislation to fix our broken borders; ensure respect for the laws of this country; recognize the important economic contribution of immigrant laborers; apprehend those who came here illegally to commit crimes; and deal practically and humanely with those who came here, as my distant ancestors did, to build a better, safer life for their families, without excusing the fact they came here illegally or granting them privileges before those who have been waiting their turn outside the country. Many Americans did not believe us when we said we would secure our borders, and so we failed in our efforts. I don't want to fail again to achieve comprehensive immigration reform. We must prove we have the resources to secure our borders and use them, while respecting the dignity and rights of citizens and legal residents of the United States. When we have achieved our border security goal, we must enact and implement the other parts of practical, fair and necessary immigration policy. We have economic and humanitarian responsibilities as well, and they require no less dedication from us in meeting them.
Several years ago, the leading newspaper in my state published an article putting faces on the tragic human costs of illegal immigration, and I would like to briefly quote from it:
So this is not just the illegal immigration problem. It is these -- I mean, these are the -- it's hard to -- the brutality and cruelty practiced by these people in the drug cartels is beyond our imagination.
"It is offensive and dishonest for Barack Obama to lie about John McCain's record on immigration and years of support for the Hispanic community, when it was Barack Obama himself who voted for 'poison pill' amendments that killed the effort at immigration reform. Instead of making false ads with baseless attacks, Barack Obama should be apologizing to the Latino community." 
First of all, tying Sen. McCain -- especially on the issue of immigration reform -- to Limbaugh is unfair.
"Everybody's making immigration proposals these days. Let me add mine to the mix. Call it The Limbaugh Laws:
The newspaper noted that McCain said he'd vote against a temporary worker program, even though he supports the idea. "I will vote against anything until we secure the borders," he said. "There is no way we're going to enact piecemeal immigration reform."
McCain has changed his rhetoric and his emphasis when discussing immigration after almost losing the GOP presidential nomination because of it.
The greater implication the ad makes, however, is that McCain is no friend to Latinos at all, beyond issues of funding the DREAM act or how NCLB money is distributed. By linking McCain to Limbaugh's quotes, twisting Limbaugh's quotes, and tying McCain to more extremist anti-immigration voices, the Obama campaign has crossed a line into misleading the viewers of its new TV ad. In Spanish, the word is errneo.
Also last week, Obama released a Spanish-language ad that portrayed McCain as anti-immigrant and anti-Hispanic and tried to link him to immigration policies that were not his own as well as some choice Rush Limbaugh quotes that appeared to insult Mexicans.
Anyone who has followed the immigration debate knows that McCain is the most pro-immigration Republican on the national stage and that he is not in the least anti-Hispanic. To pull quotes from Rush Limbaugh, who has completely different immigration views than McCain and who opposed him on that issue for years (and still does) is completely disingenuous. The ad is so bad that even The New York Times called it "misleading."
Yes, Senator McCain is a hero of the Viet Nam war and has intelligently served his country with honor and integrity. He understands the important issues of the day and has shown valor in spearheading initiatives at great political risk such as immigration reform and limiting the undue influence of money in political campaigns. He is well known for his bipartisan efforts to accomplish legislative goals.
• NPR's Juan Williams: Barack Obama "Doesn't Have The Record" Of Bipartisanship That John McCain Has. NPR'S JUAN WILLIAMS: "You think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on, and there's John McCain working across party lines. Senator Obama doesn't have a record. Now, he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics, but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesn't have the record." (Fox News' "Special Report With Brit Hume," 5/7/08)
McCain, in Congress for 26 years to Obama's four, has the longer record of producing bipartisan alliances on tough issues. He has bucked his party again and again to do just that -- on immigration, federal judges and campaign finance, to name three on which he enraged many Republicans by defying the party position and working with Democrats. McCain-the-maverick has reverted to party orthodoxy on taxes and other issues this year, which will put him in a bind if elected: Would he stick with those new positions, or compromise with the Democratic Congress he'd likely be working with?
Obama's bipartisan accomplishments in Washington have been on significant, but relatively non-controversial, efforts to secure nuclear weapons and establish a federal-spending database. What he lacks is a record of challenging his own party on divisive, difficult issues -- the deficit, immigration, energy -- that he'd have to reach out to Republicans on if he's elected. Even with a Democratic majority in Congress, it takes 60 votes in the Senate to pass most major measures.

Time and time again John McCain has put his country first. He refused early release when he was held captive in Vietnam. He continued to put his country first as a national leader in the U.S. Senate. He put country before party when he fought to pass campaign finance reform, sought a bi-partisan solution to the immigration problem, and consistently supported pro-environment policies. His courage to stand up to the failed Iraq war plan of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and lead the fight for a new strategy in Iraq will go down in history, and it saved American lives. These were not always the easy things to do. In fact, they were usually very difficult, and often threatened his political career. But John McCain did what was right.

Governor Tim Pawlenty: "Well, John McCain has a record of putting his country first as a POW, not budging in line in front of other POWs, in terms of bucking his party if that's what it takes to do what he thinks is right for the country, on a whole variety of issues. But the question really remains, when has Barack Obama stood up and taken on his party on anything of national significance? And on the issue of immigration, when John McCain was leading that issue, taking great risk and taking a pounding from his own party, Barack Obama was not significantly engaged in that debate and the accounting of the votes ultimately, where he actually put amendments or tried to support amendments that would derail immigration reform in this country. Another example of John McCain's courageous leadership and Barack Obama not walking the walk."
Our compassion for laborers who entered this country unlawfully -- our understanding of their struggles, even as we act to secure the border -- speaks well of America. But this respect does not extend to criminals who came here to break our laws and do harm to people. Through the Criminal Alien Program, we have made some progress in recent years. Too often, however, states are left to deal with the high costs and excessive regulation involved in deportation proceedings, and many local officers are left waiting for immigration agents to show up on site. So, as president, I will expand the Criminal Alien Program. We will require that the federal government assume more of the costs to deport and detain criminal aliens -- because this is a problem of the federal government's own making.
Yet the events of that long day and night in 2002 fit a pattern for a man whose congressional career long has included a singular brand of combative bipartisanship. For more than a decade, on tobacco, health care, immigration, judicial nominees, creation of a commission to investigate the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks and more, McCain has championed high-profile legislation opposed by President Bush or others in his own party.
Along the way, two officials said McCain angered another one of the 14, Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, by bluntly telling him he was taking too long to review the proposed agreement. Lieberman, then a Democrat, walked out of the session in response, according to these officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In another episode, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas responded similarly to a tongue-lashing from McCain in a closed-door meeting on immigration in the same year.
More recently, McCain has been deeply involved in unsuccessful efforts to pass immigration legislation that offers a path to citizenship for millions of men and women in the country illegally. The measure ran aground two years in a row, providing a dramatic illustration of the risks of bipartisanship.
"I as a House member was intimately involved in many of the meetings where Senator McCain was leading the effort to try to get comprehensive immigration reform passed. And Senator Obama was consistently and absolutely AWOL, nowhere to be seen in any of the meetings that we held on this issue of immigration. It's absurd for him now to try to take credit on that issue when he was nowhere to be seen." --Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart
"Let me say some final remarks with regard to the issue of immigration. Apparently, Senator Obama now is talking about the fact that he was involved in trying to make that legislation that died in the Senate a reality, to try to pass that legislation.
"I as a House member was intimately involved in many of the meetings where Senator McCain was leading the effort to try to get comprehensive immigration reform passed. And Senator Obama was consistently and absolutely AWOL, nowhere to be seen in any of the meetings that we held on this issue of immigration. It's absurd for him now to try to take credit on that issue when he was nowhere to be seen. He was an absolute non-player. He was absolutely AWOL on the issue of immigration. It's absolutely absurd now to try to take credit for having tried to save that bill.
"Senator Obama joined up with one of the most anti-immigrant senators, Senator Dorgan, to try to kill the second leg of that stool, the temporary worker program was an absolutely indispensable ingredient, and will be in the future, to immigration reform. And Senator Obama tried to kill the temporary worker program. He voted for the reduction from 400,000 to 200,000 temporary workers.
"So whether it's on the issue of immigration, where he was absolutely AWOL, opposition to the free trade agreements with our friends in this hemisphere, his support for massive tax increases on the over 2 million small businesses that are Hispanic in this country and growing in number, on all those issues Senator Obama is going to have a serious problem when he tries to persuade Hispanic that he's the right choice for president."
"I think the ad wonderfully highlights what is really the straight story on McCain and immigration. Far from him running away from the issue in the primary, as it is falsely and shamelessly claimed, in fact, he stood tall during that time. I know that so very well because I distinctly remember this very debate and his very, very clear exposition of his point of view as he was under attack by his primary opponents, some of them, for his role in his immigration reform effort that he, and I, and Senator Kennedy, and others, tried to lead in the United States Senate. What is also important that we set the record straight on is, that not only is Senator McCain clear in what his purpose was during the immigration effort, he was at the genesis of it, he led the origins of this effort, which is why the Bill is called the McCain-Kennedy Immigration Reform Bill. He has been for comprehensive immigration reform. Senator McCain has valiantly fought the good fig ht, at the height of the primary, at whatever political risk it would bring.
"In addition to that, it is secondly important that we understand Senator Obama's role, at this very point in time. And, let me point out that the immigration bill was a fragile compromise that had been brought about by a group of us that worked on it day in and day out for weeks and weeks and weeks. The fact of the matter is that that compromise consisted of several key points that we had to stand tall on, and one of those key points was the guest worker program. When Senator Obama offered Amendment 1202, that would sunset the temporary worker program in five years, that was considered by us, who were putting this bill together, to be a poison pill. Fifty-five Senators rejected the poison pill that Senator Obama attempted to put on this bill. If that amendment had passed, that would have been the end of immigration reform. Senator Kennedy voted against Senator Obama and opposed that amendment and 55 other Senators joined in doing the same. &lt; /p&gt;
"Senator Obama didn't just stop there. But, then he went on to support the Dorgan Amendment, which was an Amendment to entirely kill the temporary worker program. Without a temporary worker program, there would have been no comprehensive immigration reform. The fact of the matter is that, when it counted, Senator Obama was not there, but he was playing to the special interests that, at that time, appeared to be who he needed to play to, to advance his own political interest. Today, he's playing to a different group, and he's singing a different song to continue to advance his political interest. In the meantime, what I think is terribly unfair, and I will not continue to stand idly by and allow to happen, is his continuing to trash Senator McCain's record on comprehensive immigration reform. Senator McCain was for it during the primary, he is for it now, and he will be for it when he is President.
"Senator McCain, just to conclude and then I will be glad to take questions, completely understands that in the Senate, to get something done, you have to be a realist. I also understand that in order to get something done you also have to understand that the borders have to be secure. Why did we fail in our efforts? Because not enough Americans believed that there was a seriousness of purpose in the federal government to secure the borders. And, until that was done, the unease about that would not allow there to be a consensus and a majority, which is how you get legislation done. But I know Senator McCain as President will support, will push and will sign a comprehensive immigration reform bill, just like he supported, in those days, when he was working with us in this effort, in a bipartisan fashion, with people like Senator Kennedy."
"No matter if you are -- or are not -- voting for presumptive GOP nominee Sen. John McCain (R-Az.), he deserves credit for trying to forge a bipartisan deal on immigration in 2005 and 2006 at great personal political risk, a situation unfamiliar to rival Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.)." -- Chicago Sun-Times' Lynn Sweet
No matter if you are - or are not -- voting for presumptive GOP nominee Sen. John McCain (R-Az.), he deserves credit for trying to forge a bipartisan deal on immigration in 2005 and 2006 at great personal political risk, a situation unfamiliar to rival Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.)
The Kennedy-McCain legislation stalled in 2006, because the hardline pro- and anti-immigration forces preferred the status quo to a compromise. Another try in 2007 -- in a bill backed by McCain and Obama -- also failed.
McCain and Obama, wooing Hispanic voters, each has madeclear in recent appearances before the National Association of Latino Elected Officials and the League of United Latino American Citizens a few days ago that he would make immigration reform -- and legalizing the status of millions of illegal immigrants -- a priority if elected president. I expect each to send the same message at the upcoming National Council of La Raza conference in San Diego, where Obama speaks Sunday and McCain on Monday.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a McCain ally and a key player on immigration, said Obama was around for only a "handful" of meetings and helped destroy a 2007 compromise when he voted for making guest worker visa programs temporary. A permanent guest worker program was to be a trade for a legalization program to cover many illegal immigrants.
An Obama Senate staffer who did not want his name used disputed whether the sunset provision in the guest worker program killed the bill and said that either Obama or his top immigration staffer were in strategy sessions and that Kennedy, in his speech endorsing Obama vouched for Obama's work on immigration.
On Thursday in Fairfax, Va., Obama was asked about his qualifications to understand Latino needs. After noting his work as a community organizer and state senator -- he spoke of McCain. "John McCain bucked much of his party and worked with Ted Kennedy, worked with me and others to help shape comprehensive immigration reform legislation in the Senate. And I thought that was courageous of him." Obama, in a sly verbal stroke, made himself an equal on immigration leadership to Kennedy and demoted McCain to a helper.
Rosario Marin: "One of the things that we want to make clear is that probably Senator Obama is going to do the same thing that he has been doing when he has been meeting with different groups throughout the nation that are Hispanic organizations. And what he's going to say is the same thing that he -- most likely, he will say the same thing he's been saying, and that is that Senator McCain has changed his mind on immigration reform. And nothing could be further from the truth.
"The reality is that Senator McCain is the one senator that basically went against his own party, took the standard bearer for immigration reform. I think that needs to be fully recognized. Senator McCain did it at great political peril. He did what he thought was the right thing to do. Clearly, Washington needs to fix the problems. They have failed for the last 24 years. And here's Senator McCain, somebody who truly understands the needs not just with border states, since he's a senator that represents one of the border states -- but clearly he understands that the United States needs to fix its problem. And at great political peril he took this issue and tried to bring together all sides to on comprehensive immigration reform. It almost happened, but it didn't because of precisely people like Senator Obama, casting votes that eventually unraveled the immigration package that he had so carefully put tog ether.
"If anybody has anything to say about Senator McCain, it is that he is a person that has done what is right, has believed that he needs to do what's in the best interest of America, and America thinks it can fix this problem of immigration. He has also listened very clearly, the Senator has, to what the American people have said. And the American people have said that they want to secure the borders. And that is very important and it is paramount to ensure that we have an immigration reform that will be successful. We must not only applaud Senator McCain, but we must join him in finding solutions that will, at the end of the day, be very good not just for individual citizens, but for America as a whole.
Let me address one other issue important to all of us. As you know, I and many other colleagues twice attempted to pass comprehensive immigration legislation to fix our broken borders; ensure respect for the laws of this country; recognize the important economic contribution of immigrant laborers; apprehend those who came here illegally to commit crimes; and deal practically and humanely with those who came here, as my distant ancestors did, to build a better, safer life for their families, without excusing the fact they came here illegally or granting them privileges before those who have been waiting their turn outside the country. Many Americans did not believe us when we said we would secure our borders, and so we failed in our efforts. I don't want to fail again to achieve comprehensive immigration reform. We must prove we have the resources to secure our borders and use them, while respecting the dignity and rights of citizens and legal residents of the United States. When we have achieved our border security goal, we must enact and implement the other parts of practical, fair and necessary immigration policy. We have economic and humanitarian responsibilities as well, and they require no less dedication from us in meeting them.
Several years ago, the leading newspaper in my state published an article putting faces on the tragic human costs of illegal immigration, and I would like to briefly quote from it:
Throughout his time in public life, McCain has never been afraid to buck his party and the status quo in Washington. Eager to work across party lines, McCain joined with Democratic Sen. Russell Feingold to fix America's broken campaign finance system. Last year, McCain teamed up with Sen. Ted Kennedy to try to reform our immigration laws. And before it became popular to criticize George Bush on how the war in Iraq was managed, McCain was one of the first Republicans to call for a change in the administration's military strategy.
"So there's a stark difference in the viewpoint of what is important for America and there's a stark difference in the nature of action. John McCain is committed to doing the hard things, reaching across the aisle at times when the nation needs action to take correction in its course. He has stood on the Senate floor with Russ Feingold for campaign finance reform. He has mobilized the Gang of 14 to have Supreme Court justices put on the court. He has stood with Ted Kennedy when it was important to address immigration.
So this is not just the illegal immigration problem. It is these -- I mean, these are the -- it's hard to -- the brutality and cruelty practiced by these people in the drug cartels is beyond our imagination.
"It is a big pleasure that you guys invited me, and thanks to Senator McCain. And I am here endorsing Senator McCain because I believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation. And like I said before, he has been a fighter for the Hispanic community, and I know that for me personally, I chose him as the best candidate because he has been a fighter for the immigration issue. So for me he is the best guy to lead this nation. And once again, I want to say thank you to everybody for the support it has given me in my entire career. This is a great honor sharing this beautiful morning with everybody. I am a man of few words but with a lot of action like I always said. Senator McCain, pleasure."
Fox News'Juan Williams: "And when he spoke about bipartisanship, again he said, 'I have the scars.' And I think that was a shot at Senator Obama, saying, you know, 'I really have been in the pits battling for immigration reforms and scarred by his own party.'" (Fox News' "American Election Headquarters," 9/4/08) 
The Wall Street Journal Editorial: John McCain "Remains A Formidable Contender Because He Can Credibly Claim To Be A Reformer." "Yet Mr. McCain remains a formidable contender -- in part because of his opponent's weaknesses, but also because he can credibly claim to be a reformer who often fought his party's worst instincts, notably on spending and immigration." (Editorial, "The McCain Change," The Wall Street Journal, 9/5/08) 
"These were not areas where Barack Obama went up against the leadership of his own party nearly in the way that John McCain did on campaign finance reform, on limiting interrogation of terror detainees, on immigration reform. He did not go up against his own party on either of those issues." -- Fox News' Chris Wallace
Wallace: "But David, because you guys always talk about ethics legislation and the nuclear non-proliferation deal with Dick Lugar, I went back and looked -- both of those measures passed by unanimous consent. They were so accepted by the Senate that there was not even a vote. In fact, ethics legislation was one of the campaign promises. These were not -- if I may, if I may. These were not areas where Barack Obama went up against the leadership of his own party nearly in the way that John McCain did on campaign finance reform, on limiting interrogation of terror detainees, on immigration reform. He did not go up against his own party on either of those issues." 
That's why when I'm President, addressing the immigration problem will be a priority.
"As they recall the failure of immigration reform in Congress, Democrats want to come off as the good guys. This means burying the fact that their patrons in organized labor instructed them to kill any compromise that included guest workers -- a concept AFL-CIO President John Sweeney termed 'a bad idea (that) harms all workers.' And it means trying to refute a new Spanish-language television ad from the McCain-Palin campaign that blames Barack Obama and other Senate Democrats for undermining immigration reform in 2007 with procedural delays and 'poison pill' amendments intended to make the legislation unpalatable to Republicans." -- San Diego Union Tribune's Ruben Navarette
As they recall the failure of immigration reform in Congress, Democrats want to come off as the good guys.
And it means trying to refute a new Spanish-language television ad from the McCain-Palin campaign that blames Barack Obama and other Senate Democrats for undermining immigration reform in 2007 with procedural delays and "poison pill" amendments intended to make the legislation unpalatable to Republicans.
Translated, the ad says: "Obama and his congressional allies say they are on the side of immigrants. But are they? The press reports that their efforts were 'poison pills' that made immigration reform fail. The result: No guest worker program. No path to citizenship. No secure borders. No reform. Is that being on our side? Obama and his congressional allies: Ready to block immigration reform, but not ready to lead."
Luckily, some members of the media kept their eye on the ball and put the blame where it belonged: on Reid and the Democrats. The Washington Post's David Broder, in a column published in June 2007, blasted Reid for going "out of his way to rewrite (the immigration bill) to meet the demands of organized labor."
Now, in response to the McCain-Palin ad, Democrats are practicing revisionist history. Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey said in a statement released by the Obama campaign: "To say that Barack Obama and Senate Democrats blocked the bill that Republicans filibustered is hypocritical and not true. John McCain has lost his credibility when it comes to the immigration issue. . . . (He) cannot attack Democrats on immigration in Spanish while pandering to the extreme right Tancredo wing of the Republican Party in English."
Others on the left are also lending a hand to Democratic efforts at damage control. They include groups dedicated to the admirable goal of achieving comprehensive immigration reform. What is not so admirable is the way that these groups have turned on McCain, whom not long ago they praised for fighting the good fight on the immigration issue. Now they claim that McCain has flip-flopped.
"A Spanish-language ad approved by Sen. John McCain accuses Sen. Obama and the Democrats of derailing immigration reform? He knows better. The whole political world knows better. Comprehensive immigration reform was blocked not by Democrats but by Republicans. . . . Immigrants and Latinos are intelligent. They know the difference between fact and fiction."
During a conference call this week with reporters, NCLR Vice President Cecilia Munoz also criticized the ad and called immigration an issue that "tends to determine who the good guys are and the bad guys are for Latinos."
McCain, in Congress for 26 years to Obama's four, has the longer record of producing bipartisan alliances on tough issues. He has bucked his party again and again to do just that -- on immigration, federal judges and campaign finance, to name three on which he enraged many Republicans by defying the party position and working with Democrats. McCain-the-maverick has reverted to party orthodoxy on taxes and other issues this year, which will put him in a bind if elected: Would he stick with those new positions, or compromise with the Democratic Congress he'd likely be working with?
Obama's bipartisan accomplishments in Washington have been on significant, but relatively non-controversial, efforts to secure nuclear weapons and establish a federal-spending database. What he lacks is a record of challenging his own party on divisive, difficult issues -- the deficit, immigration, energy -- that he'd have to reach out to Republicans on if he's elected. Even with a Democratic majority in Congress, it takes 60 votes in the Senate to pass most major measures.
"It is offensive and dishonest for Barack Obama to lie about John McCain's record on immigration and years of support for the Hispanic community, when it was Barack Obama himself who voted for 'poison pill' amendments that killed the effort at immigration reform. Instead of making false ads with baseless attacks, Barack Obama should be apologizing to the Latino community." 
First of all, tying Sen. McCain -- especially on the issue of immigration reform -- to Limbaugh is unfair.
"Everybody's making immigration proposals these days. Let me add mine to the mix. Call it The Limbaugh Laws:
The newspaper noted that McCain said he'd vote against a temporary worker program, even though he supports the idea. "I will vote against anything until we secure the borders," he said. "There is no way we're going to enact piecemeal immigration reform."
McCain has changed his rhetoric and his emphasis when discussing immigration after almost losing the GOP presidential nomination because of it.
The greater implication the ad makes, however, is that McCain is no friend to Latinos at all, beyond issues of funding the DREAM act or how NCLB money is distributed. By linking McCain to Limbaugh's quotes, twisting Limbaugh's quotes, and tying McCain to more extremist anti-immigration voices, the Obama campaign has crossed a line into misleading the viewers of its new TV ad. In Spanish, the word is errneo.
Also last week, Obama released a Spanish-language ad that portrayed McCain as anti-immigrant and anti-Hispanic and tried to link him to immigration policies that were not his own as well as some choice Rush Limbaugh quotes that appeared to insult Mexicans.
Anyone who has followed the immigration debate knows that McCain is the most pro-immigration Republican on the national stage and that he is not in the least anti-Hispanic. To pull quotes from Rush Limbaugh, who has completely different immigration views than McCain and who opposed him on that issue for years (and still does) is completely disingenuous. The ad is so bad that even The New York Times called it "misleading."
This Senate maverick has spent years forging coalitions - on campaign finance reform, immigration reform, on judicial nominations - all with the intent of getting things done in the toxically partisan world of Washington.
In early 2005, when Sen. Ted Kennedy, the Democrats' Liberal Lion, sought a Republican ally to craft a comprehensive immigration-reform bill, he crossed the aisle to the one colleague he knew would have the courage to take the right course, not the most popular one. Sen. John McCain was that person.
Last year, at the height of the immigration debate, John McCain marched away from the majority of his party to support a comprehensive immigration reform bill. "Comprehensive" at the time was a euphemism for amnesty for illegal immigrants.
"John McCain is the only candidate for president that shares my values of life," Verastegui said. "He truly recognizes that we are all God's children. John McCain is someone we can trust to do what is right and follow through on what he says -- as opposed to Barack Obama, who does not share our traditional values of defending innocent life and the sanctity of marriage. Obama has proven this time and time again. During his personal experience as a POW in Vietnam, McCain renewed and strengthened his faith. And early this year in the heat of a political battle, he had the courage to stand against his own party and support comprehensive immigration reform. His resolve serves as a reminder to us all that we must vote our values and our conscience, and not vote simply by party. We can't afford a president who lacks experience and judgment and would stand for values that are out of step with the Hispanic community and this country. Although I seldom thrust myself into political campaigns, I recognize the stakes and that it's most important that we put our values first and support John McCain."
"Mr. McCain has shown the bipartisan leadership Americans want. For example, the Republican maverick has worked with Democrats on campaign finance laws, immigration reform and climate change. When party infighting brought the Senate to a standstill on judicial nominations, Mr. McCain led the way to an audacious compromise that broke the logjam. Moreover, Mr. McCain has often opposed his own party when he believed it was the right thing to do. For example, though he supported the Iraq war, Mr. McCain emerged early as a critic of the Bush strategy at a time when the safe Republican move was go along to get along. His leadership was arguably a key factor in forcing the Bush administration to change its ways, adapting a strategy that finally worked." -- The Dallas Morning News
Mr. McCain has shown the bipartisan leadership Americans want. For example, the Republican maverick has worked with Democrats on campaign finance laws, immigration reform and climate change. When party infighting brought the Senate to a standstill on judicial nominations, Mr. McCain led the way to an audacious compromise that broke the logjam.
The Arizona senator's change agenda didn't always bear fruit but he fought nobly even in defeat. For example, Mr. McCain believed so strongly in comprehensive immigration reform that he nearly destroyed his presidential campaign to fight for it.
McCain's biggest challenge is that after eight years of the Bush White House, it's hard to say his party still believes in smaller government. He has run an uneven campaign, facing an unfair share of blame for budget deficits, feeble economic growth, costly military interventions, uncontrolled immigration, emergency bailouts of misled corporations, and a diminished world opinion of America.
Yes, Senator McCain is a hero of the Viet Nam war and has intelligently served his country with honor and integrity. He understands the important issues of the day and has shown valor in spearheading initiatives at great political risk such as immigration reform and limiting the undue influence of money in political campaigns. He is well known for his bipartisan efforts to accomplish legislative goals.
In our analysis, Republican candidate John McCain has a documented record of enlightened leadership in Washington -- leadership that often has run counter to the status quo and challenged the folly of senior members of his own party. McCain never has been a conventional politician. He thinks for himself and acts on what he believes to be in the best interests of the nation, and not necessarily in the interests of his party or his own political fortunes. In an era of dismaying partisan paralysis in Washington, McCain has stood out as a bipartisan force, best illustrated by his collaboration with liberal Democratic lion Edward Kennedy on a comprehensive solution to America's immigration dilemma.
Only McCain has a record of challenging his own party on key issues such as immigration and global warming.
For instance, McCain stood up against torture and called for the closing of the Guantanamo Bay prison camp. He tried to craft a reasonable immigration compromise that increased security and created a path to citizenship for immigrants who have worked in this country for years. He worked with a Democrat on campaign finance reform. And he's far more of a conservationist than others in his party — embracing the existence of global climate change and calling for an end to mountaintop removal mining. He, like Obama, understands that a comprehensive energy plan was needed yesterday.
" He is both tested and tempered by his extensive political and military experience. But more than anything else, McCain stands out for being his own man, driven by principle and not afraid to challenge the status quo. He has been among the Senate's most independent members, repeatedly eschewing ideology to work across the aisle for bipartisan agreements. He has been willing to buck his own party, as he did in leading the push for campaign finance reform, and to rise above political gamesmanship, as he did in negotiating a compromise that broke the judicial nominee logjam. He is nearly alone in the Senate in refusing to thrust his hands into the earmark pork barrel. And he has been right on the most pressing issues of the day, from climate change to immigration." -- Detroit News
And he has been right on the most pressing issues of the day, from climate change to immigration.
Time and again -- consider immigration reform, or campaign finance law -- John McCain has opposed his own party when it was wrong, often at great political risk. In his brief time in the Senate, Sen. Obama has demonstrated no such pattern. With Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid expected to increase their majorities in Congress, that's an important consideration.
Now, I know how it is on this show. You show various segments and comments that we make thousands of, and I understand that. But the fact is I am not George Bush. The fact is that I was not popular within my own party. The fact is that when I said that we were failing in Iraq and we were going to lose, I was criticized by Republicans. The fact is when I did campaign finance reform with Russ Feingold, I was opposed by my own party and my own president. So do we share a common philosophy of the Republican Party? Of course. But I've, I've stood up against my party, not just President Bush, but others; and I've got the scars to prove it, including taking up, with Ted Kennedy, immigration reform, knowing full well that that was going to hurt my chances in the primaries. So I could go down a long list of issues with you.
McCain hasn't always been right. A campaign finance reform bill he co-authored in an attempt to stem political corruption was full of financial loopholes, which Obama has used to his advantage. In addition, the bill was an attack on political free speech. A couple of years ago, McCain also was a big backer of a Senate bill to address the huge issue of illegal immigration. The legislation didn't get anywhere, because Americans of all political stripes saw it as an immigrant "amnesty" bill and flooded Senate offices with calls opposing it.
The campaign finance and immigration bills are examples of McCain's willingness to reach out to Democrats to work on important issues, but they also provide evidence that even bipartisan legislation can be poor legislation.
On immigration, campaign-finance, global warming and other issues, we have profoundly disagreed with the Arizona senator. But in his 21 years in the Senate, we have seen a leader emerge who is not guided by the polls but who is informed by his critics. That is a rare and valuable combination of experience in any leader.
Heaven knows, John McCain isn't a perfect conservative. He's too proud of being a "maverick," which means he likes to cross the aisle and cooperate with the likes of Ted Kennedy on ill-conceived government monstrosities. His McCain-Feingold bill, for example, ignores the First Amendment in its quest for campaign finance "reform." He's too willing to open our borders for a "comprehensive" immigration plan. He can be stampeded into harmful policies because of hype about global climate change.
• NPR's Juan Williams: Barack Obama "Doesn't Have The Record" Of Bipartisanship That John McCain Has. NPR'S JUAN WILLIAMS: "You think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on, and there's John McCain working across party lines. Senator Obama doesn't have a record. Now, he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics, but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesn't have the record." (Fox News' "Special Report With Brit Hume," 5/7/08)
He was willing to put good policy ahead of his presidential campaign by joining with liberal icon Sen. Ted Kennedy on immigration reform.
He has collaborated not only with centrist Democrats, but has palled around with liberals like Sens. Ted Kennedy and Russ Feingold on tough issues like immigration and campaign reform. Few other Republicans or Democrats would similarly risk the ire of their own party.
Indeed, we have differences that are more than quibbles with some of Sen. McCain's positions. We stridently disagree with his campaign finance and immigration "reform" efforts. And we've told him so face to face.
Immigration reform, a signature issue for you. Here's how The Washington Post reported it. "The co- author of lat year's immigration bill" "John McCain, has been largely absent from this year's negotiations, as he soft-pedals his pro-immigration stance.
Trade offers opportunity; aid can help ensure that those opportunities are available to all. The United States should launch a major program designed not to increase handouts but rather to build capacity, improve education, cut red tape, and reduce the corruption that is the foremost impediment to economic growth. We should target assistance and micro-lending to the economically isolated and often indigenous populations among our free trade partners. We need to help governments do these things not only because extreme inequality threatens the future of market democracy, but also because helping Latin America expand growth and opportunity at home is an important element in curbing illegal immigration and expanding American markets.
Mexico must be a vital partner in stopping illegal immigration. President Calderon has shown strong leadership in confronting drug crime throughout his country. By extraditing drug kingpins to the United States, deploying Mexican troops to enforce order in cartel-dominated areas, and by taking on the narcotics trade so directly, he has embarked on a courageous and vital course. The Mexican government must win this war. Should the gangs and cartels prove victorious, our security will be weakened and more drugs will flow into the United States. Mexico needs more help from the United States in this effort, and in a McCain Adminstration, that help will come.
"So there's a stark difference in the viewpoint of what is important for America and there's a stark difference in the nature of action. John McCain is committed to doing the hard things, reaching across the aisle at times when the nation needs action to take correction in its course. He has stood on the Senate floor with Russ Feingold for campaign finance reform. He has mobilized the Gang of 14 to have Supreme Court justices put on the court. He has stood with Ted Kennedy when it was important to address immigration.
So this is not just the illegal immigration problem. It is these -- I mean, these are the -- it's hard to -- the brutality and cruelty practiced by these people in the drug cartels is beyond our imagination.
