And so we've been cutting in a whole bunch of areas, and we're consolidating some agencies and earmarks that are not necessary, and we're looking at the Pentagon--how do we make our defense spending smarter and better? And so we're going to be doing a lot of consolidation and cuts, but one thing we can't do is stop investing in education, in research, in infrastructure, in things like a smart grid. Those are the things that are going to make us competitive over the long term.
Then you look at the recently released Republican budget, which keeps in place a sequester — a law that is slashing both defense and non-defense spending — so that we would end up seeing hundreds of thousands of young people having less money for student loans. We would see early childhood education slots slashed. We would see the elimination of the Affordable Care Act, of course, which would mean not only that millions of people are losing health care coverage, but folks who have health care coverage — 130 million of them — would no longer be protected against discrimination because of pre-existing conditions. Four million seniors would suddenly be paying higher prescription drug prices.

If this budget became law, by the middle of the century, funding for the kinds of things I just mentioned would have to be cut by about 95 percent. Let me repeat that. Those categories I just mentioned we would have to cut by 95 percent. As a practical matter, the Federal budget would basically amount to whatever is left in entitlements, defense spending, and interest on the national debt, period. Money for these investments that have traditionally been supported on a bipartisan basis would be practically eliminated.
So let's look at Bowles-Simpson. Essentially, my differences with Bowles-Simpson were I actually proposed less revenue and slightly lower defense spending cuts. The Republicans want to increase defense spending and take in no revenue, which makes it impossible to balance the deficit under the terms that Bowles-Simpson laid out, unless you essentially eliminate discretionary spending. You don't just cut discretionary spending. Everything we think of as being pretty important--from education to basic science and research to transportation spending to national parks to environmental protection--we'd essentially have to eliminate.
But as soon as we start seeing a recovery--and my hope is, is that over the next couple of years, we will have started moving again, building back up--then what we have to do is build in a pathway for reducing our deficits. We've already, in this budget, slated that in the out years we're going to reduce nondiscretionary--nondefense discretionary spending. Everything other than defense spending and entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, we're going to reduce those to the lowest level relative to GDP of any time since the 1960s.
Which brings me to our second responsibility to our Armed Forces: giving them the resources and equipment and strategies to meet their missions. We need to keep our military the best trained, the best led, the best equipped fighting force in the world. And that's why, even with our current economic challenges, my budget increases defense spending.
We reformed our defense spending to cut out waste and save taxpayers billions of dollars while keeping us safe. I don't know if you saw today, the Washington Times, not known for a big promoter of the Obama agenda, pointed out that we had succeeded where previous administrations had failed because of the work that was done here in this Congress to finally get serious on some of these spending cuts that had been talked about for years. And this House passed commonsense financial regulatory reform to help prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again.
What really accounts for our Federal budget is Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, defense, interest on the national debt, and then everything else, from national parks to the environmental--the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency. And in order--if you just wanted to cut the deficit to balance the budget, only on nondiscretionary--or on discretionary nondefense spending--so if you wanted to exempt out all the entitlements, exempt defense, you'd have to cut all those other things by 60 percent. Sixty percent. Can you imagine?
Harry listed some of the work that you did on behalf of the American people, even under these difficult circumstances: extending health insurance to 4 million children, protecting consumers from getting ripped off by their credit card companies and kids being targeted by big tobacco. Some things that weren't noted or didn't get a lot of attention: You reformed defense spending by eliminating waste and saved taxpayers billions while keeping us safe at the same time. You gave billions of dollars of tax relief to small businesses and 95 percent of working families here in America.
But what we also have to understand is that if I take all the steps that I've put forward, and Congress follows my lead on the nondefense discretionary spending, we're prudent in terms of defense spending, and we do all the things that we've talked about, we've still got this structural deficit that we've inherited.
All right, so even if we eliminated all foreign aid and all earmarks, it doesn't solve our problem. And as far as the arguments that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are making, I think it's important to explain to people that in order for us to balance the budget while exempting entitlements, no new revenues, you'd have to cut nondiscretionary defense spending by 60 percent--cut it by 60 percent. That's everything--student loans, NASA, veterans programs--you name it, we'd have to cut by 60 percent. Six-zero.
Most of the budget is Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, defense spending, and interest on the national debt. That accounts for about 70 percent of the budget. And so all this other stuff that sometimes we argue about, that's not the big stuff. We're going to have to tackle the big stuff if we're going to get our budget under control.
So we can eliminate all foreign aid, all earmarks, and we'd still have a huge problem because most of our budget goes to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, defense spending. Those things account for about 70 percent of the budget. Everything else we do is only about 30 percent of the budget, everything from national forests to the Agriculture Department to student loans. All that stuff is only--is less than a third of our budget.
We've drafted a budget for next year that freezes all discretionary Government spending outside of national security for 3 years, a budget, by the way, that would reduce this spending--nondefense discretionary spending--to its lowest level as a share of the economy in 50 years. This isn't talked about a lot so I'm going to repeat it. Our budget would take nonsecurity defense--or nondefense spending to its lowest level since JFK--lowest level as a percentage of the economy since JFK.
But as soon as we start seeing a recovery--and my hope is, is that over the next couple of years, we will have started moving again, building back up--then what we have to do is build in a pathway for reducing our deficits. We've already, in this budget, slated that in the out years we're going to reduce nondiscretionary--nondefense discretionary spending. Everything other than defense spending and entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, we're going to reduce those to the lowest level relative to GDP of any time since the 1960s.
They can't even—Congress has not been able to identify $1.2 trillion in cuts that they're happy with. Because these same Republicans say they don't want to cut defense; they've claimed that they don't want to gut Medicare or harm the vulnerable. But the truth of the matter is, is that you can't meet their own criteria without drastically cutting Medicare or having an impact on Medicaid or affecting our defense spending. So the math just doesn't add up.
The Government is a big part of this economy, and it's interesting that a lot of times, you have people who recognize that when it comes to defense spending; some of the same folks who say we've got to cut spending or complain that Government jobs don't do anything, when it comes to that defense contractor in their district, they think, wow, this is a pretty important part of the economy in my district, and we shouldn't stop spending on that. Let's just make sure we're not spending on those other folks.
Barbara Mikulski is on the Appropriations Committee; she's fighting hard to make sure that this sequester that is slowing down growth—and we're starting to see growth slowing down because of furloughs and cuts in defense spending and a whole bunch of stuff that wasn't well thought through. We've got to make sure that we've got a budget that doesn't push our economy back down. We need a budget that pushes our economy back up.
And finally, after many years, NATO has stopped the collective decline in defense spending. Over the past 2 years, most NATO members have halted cuts and begun investing more in defense. And this means defense spending across the alliance is now scheduled to increase. I especially want to commend our friends in the U.K., Poland, Greece, Estonia—all who, along with the United States, pay their full share of at least 2 percent of GDP for our collective defense. But for those of you doing the math, that means that the majority of allies are still not hitting that 2 percent mark, an obligation we agreed to in Wales. So we had a very candid conversation about this. There's a recognition that given the range of threats that we face and the capabilities that we need, everybody has got to step up, and everybody has got to do better.
Barbara Mikulski is on the Appropriations Committee; she's fighting hard to make sure that this sequester that is slowing down growth—and we're starting to see growth slowing down because of furloughs and cuts in defense spending and a whole bunch of stuff that wasn't well thought through.

The bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal clear. I don't agree with all their proposals, but they made important progress. And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it, in domestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending through tax breaks and loopholes.
We've got to reform defense spending. We've got to reform health care spending. But we're not going to sacrifice our fundamental commitment that we made to one another through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, the safety net for our people.
So we've got to look at spending both on nonsecurity issues as well as defense spending. And then what we've said is let's take another trillion of that that we raise through a reform in the tax system that allows people like me and, frankly, you, Mark, for paying a little more in taxes. [Laughter]
And that is the debate that we're having in Washington right now. That's what this budget debate is all about. You hear people talking about debt and deficits and spending and budgets. And yes, this is about numbers, but this debate is really about the kind of future that we want. It's about what kind of country we believe in. I believe in a country where the Government lives within its means. We've got to cut spending in Washington. We've got to cut domestic spending. We've got to cut defense spending. We've got to cut health care inflation. We've got to cut spending in our Tax Code, because we spend a lot through our Tax Code with loopholes and tricks. We've got to eliminate every dime of waste. And if we want to take responsibility for the debt that we owe, then we're going to have to make some tough decisions.
But it--but now this is our responsibility. We've got to be serious about cutting spending in Washington. We've got to make cuts in domestic spending, but we also have to make cuts in defense spending. We also have to make cuts in all the loopholes in our Tax Code. Those also have to be cut.
Now, I believe in an America where Government lives within its means. We need to cut spending in Washington. We need to cut domestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, spending in our Tax Code. We've got to eliminate every dime of waste. And if we're serious about taking responsibility for the debt we owe, then we've got to make some tough decisions about the things that we can afford to do without.
See, I believe in an America where government lives within its means. We're going to have to cut spending in Washington. Deval has had to make tough choices. Tom Menino has had to make some tough choices. Sometimes there's programs you like, but you just can't do them right now. So that means we've got to cut some domestic spending, we've got to cut defense spending, we've got to cut health care spending. We've got to cut spending in our Tax Code. We've got to get rid of loopholes that aren't doing anything to promote economic growth and put people back to work. We've got to eliminate every dime of waste.
This is not just a numbers debate, this is a values debate. All of us agree that we've got to lower our deficit and lower our debt so that we have a sustainable fiscal path. All of us agree on that. We actually roughly agree on the numbers. We need to bring down the deficit by about $4 trillion over a 10- to 12-year window and start bending the cost curve on health care costs. And the question is, how do we do it? And what I've said is that we can come up with 2 trillion dollars' worth of cuts: cuts to domestic discretionary spending, which includes cuts of some things that I think are worthy and I'd like to do, but we can't afford to do right now; cuts to defense spending, where we have an obligation to make sure that our troops have the best equipment and we continue to have the finest fighting force in the world, but let's face it, the Pentagon has waste too, and we've already identified $400 billion worth of waste. We can identify at least the equivalent to make sure that we're also maintaining economic security here at home.
That doesn't mean that we can just continue spending anything we want. We're still going to have to make some tough decisions about defense spending or even some programs that I like but we may not need. But we can't close the deficit and debt just by cutting things like Head Start or Medicare. That can't be an equitable solution to solving the problem. And then we say to millionaires and billionaires, you don't have to do anything. I don't want a $200,000 tax break if it means that some senior is going to have to pay $6,000 more for their Medicare that they don't have or a bunch of kids are going to be kicked off of Head Start and aren't going to get the basics that they need in order to succeed in our society. I don't think that's good for me; I don't think it's good for the country.
Mr. Dorsey. But from Ryan: "I would cut defense spending."
