Governor Romney: "When I was running for office 12 years ago, there were a number of things that I said and felt at that time that, with the benefit of experience, I have a different view today. One of those is abortion. As governor, I've had several pieces of legislation reach my desk, which would have expanded abortion rights in Massachusetts. Each of those I vetoed. Every action I've taken as the governor that relates to the sanctity of human life, I have stood on the side of life. So talk is cheap, but action is real. And people can now look at my record."

So do you now believe that abortion is murder?
This is not about punishment. This is about allowing states to make a decision on an issue of great moral significance to a lot of people and I think, state by state, we should allow a federalist approach as it relates to the issue of abortion.
Nashua Telegraph Columnist Jennifer Horn: "Without doubt former MA Gov Mitt Romney was the winner by every scale. He was the most presidential of all, and not just in the way he combed his hair. He was clear, decisive, firm and unwavering. He was strong on defense, abortion, immigration, healthcare and the economy. He was likeable, respectful of the other candidates and set the tone for the entire debate." (Jennifer Horn, "First GOP Debate," Jennifer Horn Online, 5/4/07)
And third, I think that values also played a role in my campaign success. My opponent said that she would sign a bill in favor of gay marriage. I said that I oppose gay marriage and civil unions. My opponent favored bilingual education in school, remember? I did not. I said that to be successful in America, kids needed to learn the language of America. And as you will surely recall, my opponent wanted to lower the age of consent for an abortion from 18 to 16 - and I said no way.
It was during this battle on cloning and embryo farming that I began to focus a good deal more attention of my own views with regards to abortion.
Make no mistake: abortion and same-sex marriage are not rights to be discovered in the Constitution.
On the tenth anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Ronald Reagan observed that the Court's decision had not yet settled the abortion debate. It had become as he said, 'a continuing prod to the conscience of a nation.'
"Congressman Henry Hyde, a former speaker at this dinner, contemplated the repeal of the Illinois abortion ban when he was a state legislator. He later found the truth and became the greatest voice for life in the United States Congress in the 20th century. Conversion. President George Herbert Walker Bush once supported abortion, but later became convinced that it was immoral. Conversion. Norma McCorvey, who made up a story of being raped, became Jane Roe in the heinous case of Roe v. Wade, has stated she hated pro-life people. In 1995, she opened her heart to God, and in 1998, she was received into the Catholic Church. She is now leading a ministry to tell the truth about abortion. Conversion. God, who is the source of all truth and the giver of life, will never place an obstacle ... that we cannot overcome.
"Tonight, we have a man with us who made that journey of conversion. A man who did not always know the evil of abortion, but he saw the truth. As our Governor during a debate on embryonic stem cell research, Mitt Romney took the courageous step of consulting the leaders of the medical and scientific communities to give him insight into what he knew in his heart was wrong. Mitt Romney was a great Governor, who served with honor and distinction. But most importantly, he was a pro-life Governor. He vetoed a number of pro-abortion pieces of legislation and made many pro-life appointments. He was always there for us. He's a busy man these days and we are extra fortunate that he and his wife Ann could be with us. Governor, you have been an inspirational leader in many ways. And if I may say so, Mitt, you're looking very presidential. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming our friend, Governor Mitt Romney, to the podium as our 2007 Mullins Award Winner for Outstanding Political Leadership."

Gov. Mitt Romney: "I am pro-life. I believe that abortion is the wrong choice except in cases of incest, rape, and to save the life of the mother. I wish the people of America agreed, and that the laws of our nation could reflect that view." (Gov. Mitt Romney, Op-Ed, "Why I Vetoed Contraception Bill," The Boston Globe, 7/26/05)
Gov. Romney's Pro-Life Position Is Rooted In The Stem Cell Debate. ROMNEY: "In considering the issue of embryo cloning and embryo farming, I saw where the harsh logic of abortion can lead to the view of innocent new life as nothing more than research material or a commodity to be exploited." (Gov. Mitt Romney, Op-Ed, "Why I Vetoed Contraception Bill," The Boston Globe, 7/26/05)
Consider the double standard at work here, by the way. When a pro-life figure changes to pro-abortion, they get praised for their courage. But when someone becomes pro-life, the pundits go into high dudgeon.
And third, we were in the beginnings of a cultural crisis. Social values also played a role in my campaign success. My opponent said she would sign a bill that would sanction same sex marriage. I said that I would oppose gay marriage and civil unions. My opponent favored bilingual education. I did not. I said that to be successful in America, children need to speak the language of America. And my opponent wanted to lower the age of consent for an abortion from 18 to 16 – and I did not.
It was during this battle that I began to focus a good deal more of my thinking on abortion.
When I first ran for office, while I was always personally opposed to abortion, I considered whether this should be a private decision or whether it should be a societal and government decision. I concluded that I would support the law as it was in place – effectively, the pro-choice position.
What became clear during the cloning debate is how the harsh logic of an absolute right to abortion had cheapened the value of human life to the point that rational people saw a human embryo as nothing more than mere research material to be used, and then destroyed.
Recently, I was attacked by one of my opponents because when I ran for Governor I promised to maintain the status quo with regards to laws relating to abortion in Massachusetts. Of course, I kept that promise. But in Massachusetts, that meant vetoing pro-choice legislation – as I consistently did as Governor. That's why last month I was honored with an award from Massachusetts Citizens for Life in recognition of the actions I took as Governor to protect life.
Make no mistake: the claimed rights of abortion-on-demand and same-sex marriage are not in the Constitution.
But the problem of an activist bench goes beyond the issue of abortion and gay marriage that.

Governor Romney Will Defend The Sanctity Of Human Life. He opposes abortion and embryonic-destructive stem cell research, and will pursue a pro-life agenda. When presented with legislation on life issues in Massachusetts, Governor Romney sided with life.
Welcoming Dr. Willke's announcement, Governor Romney said, "I am proud to have the support of a man who has meant so much to the pro-life movement in our country. He knows how important it is to have someone in Washington who will actively promote pro-life policies. Policies that include more than appointing judges who will follow the law but also opposing taxpayer funded abortion and partial birth abortion. I look forward to working with Dr. Willke and welcome him to Romney for President."

"We believe that Romney is a natural ally of social conservatives. He speaks often about the toll of fatherlessness in this country. He may not have thought deeply about the political dimensions of social issues until, as governor, he was confronted with the cutting edge of social liberalism. No other Republican governor had to deal with both human cloning and court-imposed same-sex marriage. He was on the right side of both issues, and those battles seem to have made him see the stakes of a broad range of public-policy issues more clearly. He will work to put abortion on a path to extinction. Whatever the process by which he got where he is on marriage, judges, and life, we're glad he is now on our side – and we trust him to stay there."

I think abortion is something that, as a personal matter, I would advise somebody against. However, I believe in a woman's right to choose.

GIULIANI: "I would vote to preserve the option for women. I think that choice is a very difficult one. It's a very, very--it's one in which people of conscious have very, very different opinions. I think the better thing for America to do is to leave that choice to the woman, because it affects her probably more than anyone else." (NBC's "Meet The Press," 2/6/00)

I know you support a woman's right to choose. Do you think Roe vs. Wade is good, constitutional law?" GIULIANI: "Yes. I believe--I believe it is. I had in the past doubts about it before I ran for office. As I focused on the reality of what a woman has to face and the choice she has to make, the position that I felt was the correct one in a portalistic society is that we should leave that difficult choice ultimately to a woman." (ABC's "This Week," 2/6/00)
In A Survey, More Than Half Of Leaned Republicans Said That They Would Be Less Likely To Vote For Giuliani Because Of His Positions On Abortion And Civil Unions.

- Of These Voters, Two-Thirds Said There Was No Chance They Would Vote For Him. "Further, among those less likely to support Giuliani because of these issues, two-thirds (67 percent) say there's no chance they'd vote for him -- up from 49 percent earlier this year.

And the consequences? They would be like the consequences associated with the bill relating to partial birth abortion, which, of course, does not punish the woman. You, you wouldn't--I don't think anyone is calling for--maybe some of them, but no one I know of is calling for punishing the, the mother, punishing the woman.

Background On Former Senator Rick Santorum:
Mr. Santorum Served As United States Senator From Pennsylvania From 1995 To 2007 And As A Member Of The U.S. House Of Representatives From 1991 To 1995. As a United States Senator, he was a champion of efforts to counter the threat of radical Islam, to protect victims of religious persecution, and to promote democracy and religious liberty around the world. He founded the Congressional Working Group on Religious Freedom and spearheaded the passage of several key pieces of legislation, including the landmark welfare reform bill, the American Community Renewal Act, a ban on partial-birth abortion, the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, the Combating Autism Act, the Farmland Preservation Act, the Abandoned Mine Lands Reform Act, the Multi-Employer Pension Reform Act, the Global Aids Authorization Act, Health Savings Accounts, the Syria Accountability Act, and the Iran Freedom Support Act.
Sen. McCain: "It's Not Social Issues I Care About." "McCain seems distinctly uninterested when asked questions concerning abortion and gay rights. While campaigning in South Carolina, he told reporters riding with him on his bus that he was comfortable pledging to appoint judges who would strictly interpret the Constitution in part because it would reassure conservatives who might otherwise distrust him. 'It's not social issues I care about,' he explained." (Juliet Eilperin and Michael D. Shear, "Contenders Highlight GOP's Ideological Struggle," The Washington Post, 2/3/08)
- Be A Pro-Life President. As President, Governor Romney will promote pro-life polices. He will oppose taxpayer-funded abortion, partial-birth abortion, abortion in military clinics and funding of abortion in international aid programs. He will work to ban embryonic cloning. He will work to increase adoptions by making the adoption tax credit permanent and raising awareness about embryonic adoption, or snowflake babies.
Our values must also encompass the life of an unborn child. There are, of course, strong convictions on both sides of the life issue. Yet, it speaks well of our country that almost all Americans recognize that abortion is a problem. The law may call it a right, but no one ever called it a good. And in the quiet of conscience, people of both political parties know that more than a million abortions a year cannot be squared with the good heart of America.
Taking innocent life is always wrong and always tragic, wherever it happens. The compassionate instincts of this country should not be silent in the face of injustices like China's One-Child Policy. And if I am president, you will never hear me or my vice president tell the Chinese government that we "understand" and won't "second guess" compulsory sterilization and forced abortion.
We spend $300 million a year on groups like Planned Parenthood, which provide abortions or abortion-related services. It's long past time for that to be over.
We do not agree with the claims that Gov. Romney is responsible for tax payer funded abortion under the Massachusetts health care system. That blame lies solely on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court who ruled in 1981 that the Massachusetts Constitution required payment for abortions for Medicaid-eligible women. In 1997, the Court reaffirmed its position that a state-subsidized plan must offer "medically necessary abortions."
"Since being elected governor, Mitt Romney has had a consistent commitment to the culture of life. As governor, he worked closely with Massachusetts Citizens for Life. Misguided attempts to blame Mitt Romney for the fact that state-funded health care in Massachusetts funds abortion ignore the facts. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 1981 that the Massachusetts Constitution requires the funding of abortion. This decision forces Massachusetts to fund abortion to the same extent it funds other medical procedures. A 1986 attempt to overturn the court ruling with a Constitutional Amendment failed. Obviously, in providing health coverage, the governor and the legislature were bound by this decision."
"Romney signed government-mandated health care with taxpayer-funded abortions."
First, what's not in the law: the word "abortion."
But the law doesn't address what is covered and what isn't. Search the text of it, and "abortion" is nowhere to be found.
"It doesn't say in the law what is covered or not. It talks about health care and funding health care," said Anne Fox, president of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, which opposes abortion.
Most private insurance plans in the U.S. include abortion coverage, and the state-subsidized plans in Massachusetts do, too. So when the Health Connector began, abortion coverage was automatically included.
So Gingrich's ad is right that some abortions in Massachusetts are "taxpayer-funded." But that requirement long predated the law Romney signed.
"That was already a given," Fox said. "Anything that's paid for with tax money, like Medicaid, covered abortions."
Gingrich's ad says "Romney signed government-mandated health care with taxpayer-funded abortions."
What's right about that? Romney did sign government-mandated health care, and Massachusetts does provide taxpayer-funded abortions. But the ad inaccurately links the two together. The law Romney signed did not mention abortion coverage. It was included by the state exchange, which created plans that mirror private insurance nationwide. And a court decision two decades earlier mandated that the cost of the abortions be included. You'd never know any of that based on the misleading wording in the ad. We rate it Mostly False.

We do not agree with the claims that Gov. Romney is responsible for tax payer funded abortion under the Massachusetts health care system. That blame lies solely on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court who ruled in 1981 that the Massachusetts Constitution required payment for abortions for Medicaid-eligible women. In 1997, the Court reaffirmed its position that a state-subsidized plan must offer "medically necessary abortions."
As Governor, Romney fought for social conservative values. He vetoed bills that would have authorized state funding of embryonic cloning, would have changed the definition of human life from fertilization to implantation and would have given young women the morning-after abortion pill without a prescription. He promoted abstinence education in public schools. When the Massachusetts Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, he left no stone unturned to set aside that ruling. And in contrast to the Obama Administration's war on the Catholic Church by mandating their institutions to provide contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs in their health care plans, Governor Romney vetoed a bill that would have required Catholic hospitals to offer abortion-inducing drugs to potential rape victims.
In An Editorial Explaining His Veto, Gov. Romney Declared "I Am Pro-Life." "Yesterday I vetoed a bill that the Legislature forwarded to my desk. Though described by its sponsors as a measure relating to contraception, there is more to it than that. The bill does not involve only the prevention of conception: The drug it authorizes would also terminate life after conception. ... I understand that my views on laws governing abortion set me in the minority in our Commonwealth. I am pro-life. I believe that abortion is the wrong choice except in cases of incest, rape, and to save the life of the mother. I wish the people of America agreed, and that the laws of our nation could reflect that view." (Governor Mitt Romney, Op/Ed, "Why I Vetoed Contraception Bill," The Boston Globe, 7/26/05)
During my time in office, I stood up to those who wanted to call into question the very definition of life. I vetoed a bill that would have opened the door to cloning and embryo farming. I vetoed a bill that would have allowed young girls to gain access to abortion-inducing drugs. I fought for abstinence education in our public schools. And I defended the Catholic Church's right to serve their community in ways that were consistent with their conscience through adoption programs that placed children in a home with a mom and a dad.

Santorum: "There's No Question That Arlen's An Independent Guy, But He Also Understands The Concept Of Team." "Specter's Pennsylvania colleague Rick Santorum, a committed conservative, supports Specter over Pat Toomey. 'There's no question that Arlen's an independent guy, but he also understands the concept of team,' says Santorum. ... This party-line loyalty is remarkable, because Specter tried to complicate Santorum's first Senate primary by recruiting a pro-abortion woman to run against him." (Editorial, "The Awful Specter of Yet Another Term," National Review, 3/26/04)
National Catholic Reporter: "Santorum's Endorsement Served His Short-Term Political Interests." "With his enthusiastic endorsement of pro-choice stalwart Arlen Specter, R-Pa., pro-life champion Rick Santorum, R-Pa., has, arguably, done more for the cause of abortion rights than either Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., Tom Daschle, D-S.D., or John Kerry, D-Mass., will ever be able to achieve. ... What is clear, however, is that Santorum's endorsement served his short-term political interests. To party stalwarts, he proves that he is a team player, a highly valued virtue in the Bush administration. Plus, as a member of the Senate leadership, the ambitious Santorum had little choice, short of political suicide, but to endorse his pro-choice home state senior senator. Bottom line: Santorum's parochial political interests combined with the very real prospect of Republicans losing the Senate outweighed the theoretical prospect of furthering abortion rights. So, as often happens in politics, pragmatism trumped principle." (Editorial, "Endorsement Exposes Faulty Logic," National Catholic Reporter, 5/14/04)
Fiscal And Social Conservatives In Santorum's Former Home State Aren't Lining Up To Support Him. "Fiscal conservatives see him as a big-government, pork-barrel spender. And some social conservatives question his support of former Sen. Arlen Specter, who supported abortion rights." (Robert J. Vickers, "Pennsylvania GOP Leaders Believe Rick Santorum Isn't A Good Fit For The Presidency," Harrisburg Patriot-News, 1/9/12)
Specter Ran for President Because He Felt Conservatives Had Taken Over the Republican Party. "Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania announced his candidacy for the Republican Presidential nomination today and, saving his severest criticism for the right wing of his own party, said the nominee should not be 'captive to the demands of the intolerant right.' ... Mr. Specter, 65, said he had been drawn into the race because no one else in his party was speaking out in favor of abortion rights or challenging the party's increasingly influential religious conservatives." (Richard L. Berke, "Joining Race, Specter Attacks the Right," The New York Times, 3/31/95)
The Obama Campaign Has Alleged Governor Romney Would Outlaw Abortion In Cases Of Rape And Incest. "An Obama campaign ad twists Mitt Romney's stance on abortion, claiming Romney 'backed a law that outlaws all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest.'" (Robert Farley, "Twisting Romney's Abortion Stance," FactCheck.org, 7/9/12)
Where the current administration has shown its sympathy for the pro-abortion lobby, Mitt Romney will be a faithful defender of life in all its seasons. And he understands the special duty of people of faith to serve in this cause. As Governor Romney recently said, "From the beginning, this nation trusted in God, not man. Religious liberty is the first freedom in our Constitution. And whether the cause is justice for the persecuted, compassion for the needy and the sick, or mercy for the child waiting to be born, there is no greater force for good in the nation than Christian conscience in action."
The Obama Campaign Ran A False Ad About Governor Romney's Position On Abortion. "The Obama campaign is out with another ad making the false claim that Mitt Romney 'backed a bill that outlaws all abortion, even in cases of rape and incest.' Romney's consistent position through this campaign, and the last, and as far back as 2005, is that he opposes abortion except in cases when the life of the mother is in danger, and in cases of rape and incest." (Robert Farley, "Falsifying Romney's Abortion Stance, Again," FactCheck.org, 7/31/12)
In 2011, Biden Endorsed China's One-Child Policy Which Includes Forced-Sterilization And Abortion. "Vice President Biden has emphatically backed away from his apparent endorsement of China's one-child policy. ...The one-child policy has rested on coercion, including forced sterilization and abortion, as well as incentives." (Editorial, "Mr. Biden Stumbles In China, Twice," The Washington Post, 8/24/11)
So do you now believe that abortion is murder?
This is not about punishment. This is about allowing states to make a decision on an issue of great moral significance to a lot of people and I think, state by state, we should allow a federalist approach as it relates to the issue of abortion.

Background On Former Senator Rick Santorum:
Mr. Santorum Served As United States Senator From Pennsylvania From 1995 To 2007 And As A Member Of The U.S. House Of Representatives From 1991 To 1995. As a United States Senator, he was a champion of efforts to counter the threat of radical Islam, to protect victims of religious persecution, and to promote democracy and religious liberty around the world. He founded the Congressional Working Group on Religious Freedom and spearheaded the passage of several key pieces of legislation, including the landmark welfare reform bill, the American Community Renewal Act, a ban on partial-birth abortion, the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, the Combating Autism Act, the Farmland Preservation Act, the Abandoned Mine Lands Reform Act, the Multi-Employer Pension Reform Act, the Global Aids Authorization Act, Health Savings Accounts, the Syria Accountability Act, and the Iran Freedom Support Act.

This is not about punishment. This is about allowing states to make a decision on an issue of great moral significance to a lot of people and I think, state by state, we should allow a federalist approach as it relates to the issue of abortion.
And third, I think that values also played a role in my campaign success. My opponent said that she would sign a bill in favor of gay marriage. I said that I oppose gay marriage and civil unions. My opponent favored bilingual education in school, remember? I did not. I said that to be successful in America, kids needed to learn the language of America. And as you will surely recall, my opponent wanted to lower the age of consent for an abortion from 18 to 16 - and I said no way.
It was during this battle on cloning and embryo farming that I began to focus a good deal more attention of my own views with regards to abortion.
Make no mistake: abortion and same-sex marriage are not rights to be discovered in the Constitution.
On the tenth anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Ronald Reagan observed that the Court's decision had not yet settled the abortion debate. It had become as he said, 'a continuing prod to the conscience of a nation.'

(Kevin Jourdain, Remarks, Agawam, MA, 5/10/07)
Consider the double standard at work here, by the way. When a pro-life figure changes to pro-abortion, they get praised for their courage. But when someone becomes pro-life, the pundits go into high dudgeon.
And third, we were in the beginnings of a cultural crisis. Social values also played a role in my campaign success. My opponent said she would sign a bill that would sanction same sex marriage. I said that I would oppose gay marriage and civil unions. My opponent favored bilingual education. I did not. I said that to be successful in America, children need to speak the language of America. And my opponent wanted to lower the age of consent for an abortion from 18 to 16 – and I did not.
It was during this battle that I began to focus a good deal more of my thinking on abortion.
When I first ran for office, while I was always personally opposed to abortion, I considered whether this should be a private decision or whether it should be a societal and government decision. I concluded that I would support the law as it was in place – effectively, the pro-choice position.
What became clear during the cloning debate is how the harsh logic of an absolute right to abortion had cheapened the value of human life to the point that rational people saw a human embryo as nothing more than mere research material to be used, and then destroyed.
Recently, I was attacked by one of my opponents because when I ran for Governor I promised to maintain the status quo with regards to laws relating to abortion in Massachusetts. Of course, I kept that promise. But in Massachusetts, that meant vetoing pro-choice legislation – as I consistently did as Governor. That's why last month I was honored with an award from Massachusetts Citizens for Life in recognition of the actions I took as Governor to protect life.
Make no mistake: the claimed rights of abortion-on-demand and same-sex marriage are not in the Constitution.
But the problem of an activist bench goes beyond the issue of abortion and gay marriage that.
