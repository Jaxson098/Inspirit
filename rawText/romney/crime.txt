The, the current Brady Bill is, is a different measure than the original. The original had a waiting period because it took a long time to check on people's backgrounds. Today we can check instantly on backgrounds. I don't want to cause a waiting period that's not necessary based upon today's technology. But my position is we should check on the backgrounds of people who are trying to purchase guns. We also should keep weapons of unusual lethality from being on the street. And finally, we should go after people who use guns in the commission of crimes or illegally, but we should not interfere with the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose. I support the work of the NRA. I'm a member of the NRA. But do we line up on every issue? No, we don't.
"'I don't believe in rounding up 11 million people and forcing them at gunpoint from our country. With these 11 million people, let's have them registered, know who they are. Those who've been arrested or convicted of crimes shouldn't be here; those that are paying taxes and not taking government benefits should begin a process towards application for citizenship, as they would from their home country.'"
Boston, MA – Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, "Choice: Judgment." The ad highlights the very important choice voters will have to make when it comes to fighting crime in the United States. While Governors Romney and Huckabee both believe in protecting life and traditional marriage, they have very different crime records. In Massachusetts, Governor Romney fought for tougher penalties to combat methamphetamines and respected juries' decisions by not pardoning a single criminal. In Arkansas, Governor Huckabee granted 1,033 pardons and commutations, including 12 convicted murderers. This was more clemencies than the previous three governors combined. Governor Huckabee also reduced penalties for manufacturing methamphetamines.
"On crime. The difference is judgment."

His focus as a city council member has been on combating crime, restoring decency and improving transportation, schools and the environment for the citizens of Jacksonville.
Further, I'd promote an international initiative to develop a new body of international law that would make nuclear trafficking a crime against humanity, on a par with genocide and war crimes. And by allowing for universal jurisdiction, charges can be brought up at any court, to help prevent traffickers from hiding in complicit or weak countries. Already, people have been caught trying to smuggle nuclear materials to sell them on the black market. Their acts shouldn't be dismissed with the kind of nonchalance that sometimes accompanies routine violation of the laws.
- Making Nuclear Trafficking A Crime Against Humanity. Governor Romney would promote an international initiative to develop a new body of international law making nuclear trafficking a crime against humanity, on a par with genocide and war crimes. With universal jurisdiction, charges can be brought up in any court, preventing traffickers from hiding in complicit or weak countries. Already, people have been caught attempting to smuggle nuclear materials for sale on the black market. Their acts should not be dismissed as routine violations of the law.
Romney For President Special Adviser On Life Issues Jim Bopp: "Romney attacks McCain-Feingold because the 'electioneering communication' prohibition imposes a 'free speech blackout period,' where corporations, including non-profit advocacy groups, and labor unions would commit a federal crime if they mentioned the name of a federal candidate in a broadcast ad within 30 days of a primary and 60 of a general election. ... There can be no doubt that this 'free speech blackout period' is an 'unprecedented restriction on the political activities of everyday Americans.'"

"I am proud to have the endorsement of one of the finest members of the House of Representatives. Congressman Smith has served his community, state and nation with honor and steadfast leadership. For decades, he has been a powerful voice in Congress on judiciary issues, crime and immigration. I am grateful to have his counsel in this campaign," said Governor Romney.
- Governor Mitt Romney: "There are a lot of things about Washington that give me real pause. One, by the way, is just watching the scandalous behavior that has been alleged on both sides of the aisle, but frankly I'm particularly disappointed in our own. ... [W]e'll see how many are accurate, but I think we're going to have to find a way to demand a higher standard. There is no excuse for unethical conduct on the part of people who go to Washington to serve this country. One thing I'd like to add, if I'm lucky enough to be President, I will fight for a provision, for a law, which says that if you're convicted of a crime as a government employee or an appointee – you're convicted of a crime that involves violation of the public trust, you've done some kind of abuse of your position – that you get stripped of your pension. A lot of people go [to Washington] for pensions. We're going to take away their pensions if they violate our trust." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At An Ask Mitt Anything, Urbandale, IA, 8/2/07)

Fox News' Bill O'Reilly: "I want to get very specific with you. We only have you for a short time and you can come back any time you want. But we've been reporting on this illegal alien criminal problem, as you know, all right? And right now, you have many cities in the United States that will not report to the federal government, homeland security, when they arrest an illegal alien for a violent crime, rape and murder. They just won't tell the feds that we have so-and-so in custody. The city of New Haven is perhaps the worst of them all. They won't even execute federal warrants, so when a judge signs a warrant for an illegal alien's arrest, criminal, whether he skipped bail, whatever, the city of New Haven says we're not going to help you out. As President, what would you do about the city of New Haven, Connecticut?"
Governor Romney: "We got authorization from ICE to be able to, if you will, detain people who'd come into our state illegally or come into our country illegally, and those that the State Police came across, whether at a traffic stop or at a crime, they could detain, turn over to ICE and have them deported."
Governor Romney: "Well, a couple of things. We talked about immigration the other night and there's a big difference between us there. I think Mayor Giuliani and Senator McCain are wrong in saying that all those that have come here illegally, unless they committed a crime, should be able to stay. I think that's a mistake.
And when you consider the source of most of society's social problems, from teenage pregnancy to drug use to crime, you will find that they stem from the breakdown of the family.
Sen. Hillary Clinton Supports Sanctuary City Policies; Blames The Federal Government For Them. MSNBC's TIM RUSSERT: "Senator Clinton, would you allow the sanctuary cities to exist?" SEN. CLINTON: "Well, in addition to the general points that have been made, that I agree with, why do they have sanctuary cities? In large measure because if local law enforcement begins to act like immigration enforcement officers, what that means is that you will have people not reporting crimes. You will have people hiding from the police. And I think that is a real direct threat to the personal safety and security of all the citizens. So this is a result of the failure of the federal government, and that's where it needs to be fixed." (MSNBC Democratic Presidential Debate, Dartmouth, NH, 9/26/07)
Sen. Hillary Clinton Believes Cities Have No Choice But To Ignore Federal Immigration Laws. RUSSERT: "But you would allow the sanctuary cities to disobey the federal law." SEN. CLINTON: "Well, I don't think there is any choice. The ICE groups go in and raid individuals, but if you're a local police chief and you're trying to solve a crime that you know people from the immigrant community have information about, they may not talk to you if they think you're also going to be enforcing the immigration laws."

Yesterday, Giuliani Falsely Claimed That "Violent Crime" Went Up In Massachusetts. "'Gov. Romney did not have a good record in dealing with violent crime.' Giuliani pulled a sheet of paper out of his pocket that listed FBI crime statistics for Massachusetts while Romney was governor. Murders were up 7.5 percent, robbery was up 12 percent, he said. 'He had an increase in murder and violent crime while he was governor,' Giuliani said. 'So it's not so much the isolated situation which he and the judge will have to explain _ he's kind of thrown her under the bus, so it's hard to know how this is all going to come out. But the reality is, he did not have a record of reducing violent crime.'" (Charles Babington, "Romney Calls On Judge He Appointed To Resign After Washington State Murders," The Associated Press, 11/24/07)
Under Governor Romney, the violent crime rate in Massachusetts decreased by over 7%. The violent crime rate was lower than the national average. Prior to Governor Romney, the violent crime rate was increasing.
Under Governor Romney, The Overall Crime Rate Fell By 8% Over His Four Years In Office. "Car thefts and larcenies also were down, in line with national trends, and helped contribute to an overall 8 percent decline in crime during Romney's four years, according to the FBI stats."

Mayor Giuliani Said That New York City Only Allowed Illegal Immigrants To Go To School, Report Crimes, And Receive Emergency Medical Care. MAYOR GIULIANI: "New York City was not a sanctuary city. New York City did three exceptions. The three exceptions were to allow children to go to school, to allow those illegal immigrants who were the victims of crime to report the person who assaulted them, beat them up, mugged them. And third, to allow emergency care in the hospitals, which we were required to do by federal law." (CNN/YouTube, Republican Presidential Candidate Debate, St. Petersburg, FL, 11/28/07)
"Asked on ABC Television's 'This Week' about his Arkansas record on the issue, Mr. Huckabee replied: 'You don't punish a child because a parent committed a crime, or committed a sin, you just don't do it.' He didn't rule out extending this principle to the federal level, but suggested that he might view state and federal benefits differently."

Mayor Giuliani Wanted To Give A "Zone Of Protection" To Illegal Immigrants. GIULIANI: "So that we wouldn't have 40, 50, 60, 70,000, 80,000 children out of school and in the streets of the city and in apartments. We gave that kind of protection to people who might have been beaten or the victims of crime, so that they could get relief and help and so that they could assist the rest of us in society by reporting people who committed crimes, and it gave that relief and zone of protection to people who were sick and needed humane and decent services." (NPR's "Weekend Edition Saturday," 10/12/96)
The Associated Press: "Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee can find plenty of parallels between his native Arkansas and Iowa when it comes to methamphetamine: Both are small states battling increased use of the drug through stricter laws. But Republican presidential rivals Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson are tagging Huckabee as soft on crime because of a 2005 Arkansas law he signed as governor that gave some meth offenders more credit for good behavior. Instead of serving only 70 percent of their sentences, they'd only have to serve at least half if they behaved." (Andrew DeMillo, "Huckabee Criticized For Meth Bill," The Associated Press, 12/20/07)
The Bill Lowered Mandatory Minimums For Meth Manufacturers From 70 Percent Of A Sentence To Only 50 Percent Of A Sentence. "Senate Bill 387 repeals a 1997 law requiring those convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine, among other crimes, to serve at least 70 percent of their sentence. Approved by a unanimous vote in the Senate and by a 56-32 vote in the House, SB 387 allows those inmates to serve half of their sentence if they've earned 'good time' for good behavior." (Arkansas House Of Representatives, "Prison Crowding And Saving Teachers' Insurance Plans Gain House Approval," Press Release, http://www.arkansas.gov/, 3/11/05)
Huckabee Said He Was Against "Putting People In Unnecessarily Long Sentences When There Really Was No Call For It." STEPHANOPOULOS: "Why did you sign a bill that your local paper called a relief bill for meth manufacturers?" HUCKABEE: "Well, they called it that but it was actually making sure that we had reasonable, responsible policies and prison terms. We were hard on drug offenders and drug dealers. But here's what we also tried to do. To balance being tough on drug dealers, tough on crime, but also being a little bit kinder to the taxpayers and not putting people in unnecessarily long sentences when there really was no call for it. Our prison director, I think said it best. He said, we lock up a lot of people we're mad at not just the people we're afraid of. So, we didn't coddle criminals. But what we did do, in many cases of non-violent drug offenders was create drug courts which created a different pathway so that people who had not committed a violent crime, who were drug users, who didn't have previous offenses, went into rehab and that cost w about $4 a day versus incarceration of some $43 a day." (ABC's "This Week," 12/2/07; www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv648uLzKyo)
Welcoming Congressman Carter's support, Governor Romney said, "As one of our party's leaders in Congress, Representative Carter has been a strong proponent of our common conservative values. He has worked tirelessly to defend the American people against crime and threats from abroad. I am proud to have his support and look forward to working with him as we campaign in Texas and across the country."
"I believe in safe and responsible gun ownership. I also applaud the efforts of Second Amendment supporters – particularly in the aftermath of the terrible crimes at Virginia Tech – to support measures to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System as a screening tool to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those judged mentally incompetent. I will protect the promise of a fair and instant check and oppose any effort to expand the NICS beyond its original purpose. I was pleased, in fact, that recently, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Act with NRA support and over liberal opposition to finance, improve, and streamline the current NICS system.
"I believe that any discussion regarding firearms and crime control must focus on the criminal. Unfortunately, many in Washington believe that restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners will diminish violent crime. They are wrong. Over the years, the idea that it is possible to curtail crime by banning firearms has run up against a mountain of empirical evidence that forces one to conclude that gun control laws fail because they rely on the cooperation of a very unlikely element – the criminal. Any measure that fails to focus on the criminal and infringes on the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans will be a non-starter for me.
Boston, MA – Today, Romney for President launched its newest web ad, "Roundhouse Kick." Governor Mike Huckabee and Chuck Norris may be campaigning together but they don't see eye to eye on fighting crime. Norris believes in giving a presidential pardon to "no one, ever." Governor Huckabee granted 1,033 pardons and commutations, including 12 convicted murderers. The Texas Ranger can subdue criminals with just his icy stare. Now only if he could convince Governor Huckabee it was wrong to grant more clemencies than the previous three governors combined.
"But where do they stand on crime?
- Chuck Norris: No Pardons Ever. "I was wondering the other day, if I ran for president, what would be my campaign promises? I made a list I'm certain can get me elected. If I'm elected president, I will... Give a presidential pardon to ... no one, ever. Baretta was right in the '70s, 'Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time. Don't do it!'"

"It is an honor to have the support of Sheriff Babeu," said Mitt Romney. "His efforts working to protect our border are critical to lowering crime, reducing illegal immigration, and stopping both drug and human trafficking. Sheriff Babeu has been a leader in the call for the federal government to secure the border. As President, I will work with leaders like Sheriff Babeu to protect our Southern border, provide the required assistance from the federal government, and put an end to the magnets that cause illegal immigration."
"Ann and I are deeply saddened by the news of the senseless violence that took the lives of 15 people in Colorado and injured dozens more. We are praying for the families and loved ones of the victims during this time of deep shock and immense grief. We expect that the person responsible for this terrible crime will be quickly brought to justice."
"After spending weeks refusing to denounce his Super PAC's scurrilous ad against Mitt Romney, President Obama once again failed to lead. Worse yet, the President falsely alleged no one in his campaign had accused Mitt Romney of committing a crime. President Obama's failure to stand up to dishonest rhetoric and attacks demonstrates yet again he's diminished the office that he holds and his record is nothing more than business as usual in Washington." – Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
"Having served as a county sheriff, I know that these brave men and women put their lives on the line every day to protect our families," said Congressman Dave Reichert. "They deserve a president who appreciates their sacrifices and understands what it takes to keep Americans safe. Mitt Romney will be that president, and together with Paul Ryan, they will usher in a new era of leadership in Washington that creates good jobs, brings down the poverty rate, and helps provide a future other than crime for our at-risk youth. I am proud to support them."

I support the work of the NRA. I'm a member of the NRA. But do we line up on every issue? No, we don't.
"'I don't believe in rounding up 11 million people and forcing them at gunpoint from our country. With these 11 million people, let's have them registered, know who they are. Those who've been arrested or convicted of crimes shouldn't be here; those that are paying taxes and not taking government benefits should begin a process towards application for citizenship, as they would from their home country.'"
Those that have committed crimes should be taken out of the country. Those that are in our jails should be taken out of the country. Those who are on welfare, require government assistance, should leave the country.
It used to be that you felt it was a crime-ridden city. It's not anymore. And then, of course, following 9/11, he did a wonderful job in recovery.
"I am proud to have the endorsement of one of the finest members of the House of Representatives. Congressman Smith has served his community, state and nation with honor and steadfast leadership. For decades, he has been a powerful voice in Congress on judiciary issues, crime and immigration. I am grateful to have his counsel in this campaign," said Governor Romney.
Fox News' Bill O'Reilly: "I want to get very specific with you. We only have you for a short time and you can come back any time you want. But we've been reporting on this illegal alien criminal problem, as you know, all right? And right now, you have many cities in the United States that will not report to the federal government, homeland security, when they arrest an illegal alien for a violent crime, rape and murder. They just won't tell the feds that we have so-and-so in custody. The city of New Haven is perhaps the worst of them all. They won't even execute federal warrants, so when a judge signs a warrant for an illegal alien's arrest, criminal, whether he skipped bail, whatever, the city of New Haven says we're not going to help you out. As President, what would you do about the city of New Haven, Connecticut?"
Governor Romney: "We got authorization from ICE to be able to, if you will, detain people who'd come into our state illegally or come into our country illegally, and those that the State Police came across, whether at a traffic stop or at a crime, they could detain, turn over to ICE and have them deported."
Governor Romney: "Well, a couple of things. We talked about immigration the other night and there's a big difference between us there. I think Mayor Giuliani and Senator McCain are wrong in saying that all those that have come here illegally, unless they committed a crime, should be able to stay. I think that's a mistake.
Sen. Hillary Clinton Supports Sanctuary City Policies; Blames The Federal Government For Them. MSNBC's TIM RUSSERT: "Senator Clinton, would you allow the sanctuary cities to exist?" SEN. CLINTON: "Well, in addition to the general points that have been made, that I agree with, why do they have sanctuary cities? In large measure because if local law enforcement begins to act like immigration enforcement officers, what that means is that you will have people not reporting crimes. You will have people hiding from the police. And I think that is a real direct threat to the personal safety and security of all the citizens. So this is a result of the failure of the federal government, and that's where it needs to be fixed." (MSNBC Democratic Presidential Debate, Dartmouth, NH, 9/26/07)
Sen. Hillary Clinton Believes Cities Have No Choice But To Ignore Federal Immigration Laws. RUSSERT: "But you would allow the sanctuary cities to disobey the federal law." SEN. CLINTON: "Well, I don't think there is any choice. The ICE groups go in and raid individuals, but if you're a local police chief and you're trying to solve a crime that you know people from the immigrant community have information about, they may not talk to you if they think you're also going to be enforcing the immigration laws." (MSNBC Democratic Presidential Debate, Dartmouth, NH, 9/26/07)
Townhall's Mary Katharine Ham: "... I grew up in the inner city, in public schools. The plight of those who live there is real, sad, and cannot often be solved by the Nanny State. Romney focuses on families, empowerment, police protection in solving black-on-black crime, and invokes Bill Cosby. Well done. It addressed the question directly and treated the questioners' concerns with respect. It was a serious answer with real application, not a flippant appeal to the family values crowd that would have made him look disconnected, which it easily could have been." (Mary Katharine Ham, "Romney's Winner Answer on Black-on-Black Crime," Townhall.com, www.townhall.com, 11/28/07)
National Review's Seth Leibsohn: "I'd be surprised after this debate if Mitt doesn't see national numbers looking more like his Iowa or NH numbers after tonight's performance. Brilliant response to the black on black crime questions." (Seth Leibsohn, "Changing Times," National Review's The Corner, http://corner.nationalreview.com, Posted 11/28/07)
Mayor Giuliani Said That New York City Only Allowed Illegal Immigrants To Go To School, Report Crimes, And Receive Emergency Medical Care. MAYOR GIULIANI: "New York City was not a sanctuary city. New York City did three exceptions. The three exceptions were to allow children to go to school, to allow those illegal immigrants who were the victims of crime to report the person who assaulted them, beat them up, mugged them. And third, to allow emergency care in the hospitals, which we were required to do by federal law." (CNN/YouTube, Republican Presidential Candidate Debate, St. Petersburg, FL, 11/28/07)
"Asked on ABC Television's 'This Week' about his Arkansas record on the issue, Mr. Huckabee replied: 'You don't punish a child because a parent committed a crime, or committed a sin, you just don't do it.' He didn't rule out extending this principle to the federal level, but suggested that he might view state and federal benefits differently."
The, the current Brady Bill is, is a different measure than the original. The original had a waiting period because it took a long time to check on people's backgrounds. Today we can check instantly on backgrounds. I don't want to cause a waiting period that's not necessary based upon today's technology. But my position is we should check on the backgrounds of people who are trying to purchase guns. We also should keep weapons of unusual lethality from being on the street. And finally, we should go after people who use guns in the commission of crimes or illegally, but we should not interfere with the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose.

Mayor Giuliani Wanted To Give A "Zone Of Protection" To Illegal Immigrants. GIULIANI: "So that we wouldn't have 40, 50, 60, 70,000, 80,000 children out of school and in the streets of the city and in apartments. We gave that kind of protection to people who might have been beaten or the victims of crime, so that they could get relief and help and so that they could assist the rest of us in society by reporting people who committed crimes, and it gave that relief and zone of protection to people who were sick and needed humane and decent services." (NPR's "Weekend Edition Saturday," 10/12/96)

"It is an honor to have the support of Sheriff Babeu," said Mitt Romney. "His efforts working to protect our border are critical to lowering crime, reducing illegal immigration, and stopping both drug and human trafficking. Sheriff Babeu has been a leader in the call for the federal government to secure the border. As President, I will work with leaders like Sheriff Babeu to protect our Southern border, provide the required assistance from the federal government, and put an end to the magnets that cause illegal immigration."
