So we've got some education to do and we've got some tightening to do, but negotiation and engaging with the Iranians at this point is not the way to go and neither is invading them.
And third, I think that values also played a role in my campaign success. My opponent said that she would sign a bill in favor of gay marriage. I said that I oppose gay marriage and civil unions. My opponent favored bilingual education in school, remember? I did not. I said that to be successful in America, kids needed to learn the language of America. And as you will surely recall, my opponent wanted to lower the age of consent for an abortion from 18 to 16 - and I said no way.
- Governor Romney: "As you know, every time I faced a decision as the Governor that related to human life, I came down on the side of the sanctity of life. I fought to ban cloning. I fought to ban embryo farming. I fought to define life as beginning at conception rather than at implantation. I fought for abstinence education in our schools. I vetoed a so-called emergency contraception bill that gave young girls drugs without prescription, drugs that could be abortive and not just contraceptive. That's my record as your Governor." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At The Massachusetts Citizens For Life Mother's Day Pioneer Valley Dinner, Agawam, Massachusetts, 5/10/07)
And third, we were in the beginnings of a cultural crisis. Social values also played a role in my campaign success. My opponent said she would sign a bill that would sanction same sex marriage. I said that I would oppose gay marriage and civil unions. My opponent favored bilingual education. I did not. I said that to be successful in America, children need to speak the language of America. And my opponent wanted to lower the age of consent for an abortion from 18 to 16 – and I did not.
The implications of the marriage decision quickly went well beyond adult marriage. Efforts were made to change birth certificates by removing 'mother' and 'father' and replacing them with 'parent A' and 'parent B.' I said no to that. And parents of a child in second grade were told that their son is required to listen to the reading of a book called the 'King and the King,' about a prince who marries another prince. The school's rationale was since same sex marriage was legal, the education system should advance the idea.
Governor Romney Has Outlined A Conservative Blueprint To Strengthen Our Economy. In addition to lowering taxes on the American people and bringing fiscal responsibility to Washington, Governor Romney's economic blueprint includes initiatives to reform the tort system, become energy secure, strengthen our education system and promote trade around the world.
Governor Romney Will Work To Better Schools And Better Education For Our Children. Governor Romney believes in school choice and that every child should have an equal opportunity to have a good education. He supported school choice and fought for charter schools in Massachusetts, and he will do the same thing in Washington.

Former Secretary Of Education Bill Bennett: "Mitt Romney talked about education as the next civil right...Liberals have failed inner city blacks overwhelmingly in the last 30 years. That's why the question from the father and son was so pertinent and I thought Romney did a good job on it." (CNN's "Post Debate Coverage," 11/28/07)
- Create Worker Empowerment And Training Accounts. These self-managed accounts will give workers the opportunity to take control of their own futures by getting the training and education they need to succeed in the new economy.
- Streamline And Enhance Access To Worker Training And Educational Programs. Governor Romney will initiate an audit of all existing worker training and educational programs to ensure that workers are being helped most efficiently.
- Strengthen Our Education System. As President, Governor Romney will emphasize math and science education, while promoting innovative approaches such as charter schools and public-private partnerships.
Governor Romney Will Strengthen Our Education System. As President, Governor Romney will emphasize math and science education, while promoting innovative approaches such as charter schools and public-private partnerships. To ensure our education system prepares our children for a new generation of challenges, Governor Romney will:
- Promote School Choice. He believes that when parents and kids are free to choose their school, everyone benefits. That's because competition and choice in educational opportunities – whether it comes from private schools, charter schools, or home schooling – makes traditional public schools better and improves the quality of education for all of America's kids.
- Propose A Federal Home Schooling Tax Credit. As of 2003, there were nearly 1.1 million home schooled students in the United States. Governor Romney believes that parents who want to home school their kids should be able to do so. To help them, he will provide a tax credit to help defray the educational expenses of parents who home school their kids.
- Believe Our Education System Works Best When We Have More Local Control Of Our Schools. While there is a proper role for the federal government to play in education, it is not in telling parents, teachers, kids and local authorities what to teach or how to run their schools.
Fought for abstinence education.  In 2006, under Governor Romney's leadership, Massachusetts' public schools began to offer a classroom program on abstinence from the faith-based Boston group Healthy Futures to middle school students.  Promoting the program, Governor Romney stated, "I've never had anyone complain to me that their kids are not learning enough about sex in school. However, a number of people have asked me why it is that we do not speak more about abstinence as a safe and preventative health practice."

As Governor, Romney fought for social conservative values. He vetoed bills that would have authorized state funding of embryonic cloning, would have changed the definition of human life from fertilization to implantation and would have given young women the morning-after abortion pill without a prescription. He promoted abstinence education in public schools. When the Massachusetts Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, he left no stone unturned to set aside that ruling. And in contrast to the Obama Administration's war on the Catholic Church by mandating their institutions to provide contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs in their health care plans, Governor Romney vetoed a bill that would have required Catholic hospitals to offer abortion-inducing drugs to potential rape victims.
During my time in office, I stood up to those who wanted to call into question the very definition of life. I vetoed a bill that would have opened the door to cloning and embryo farming. I vetoed a bill that would have allowed young girls to gain access to abortion-inducing drugs. I fought for abstinence education in our public schools. And I defended the Catholic Church's right to serve their community in ways that were consistent with their conscience through adoption programs that placed children in a home with a mom and a dad.

At Last Night's Debate, Santorum Was Booed When He Said You Sometimes Have To Set Principles Aside And "Take One For The Team." SANTORUM: "I supported No Child Left Behind. I supported it. It was the principal priority of President Bush to try to take on a failing education system ... I have to admit, I voted for that. It was against the principles I believed in, but, you know, when you're part of the team, sometimes you take one for the team, for the leader, and I made a mistake. ... [BOOING] ... You know, politics is a team sport, folks. And sometimes you've got to rally together and do something." (GOP Presidential Debate, Mesa, AZ, 2/22/12)

Giuliani Reaffirmed CUNY's Policy Of Giving In-State Tuition To Illegal Immigrants When He Renewed New York's Sanctuary Policy. "CUNY's policy of charging illegal immigrants the lower rate reflected the city's historic embrace of immigrants and conformed to a policy laid out by Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1989 and reaffirmed by Mayors David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani. In reviewing the policy, Mr. Schaffer came across a brief section of a 1996 immigration law that said illegal immigrants should not be eligible for educational benefits not available to American citizens from other states, CUNY officials said. When the law was passed, CUNY lawyers reviewed it and decided that the university should not make changes until regulations were issued to carry out the law. Mr. Schaffer said he concluded, however, that at this point the university had no choice but to change its tuition policy." (Karen W. Arenson, "CUNY Raises Tuition Rates For Foreigners Here Illegally," The New York Times, 11/3/01)
The Washington Post Recently Noted That Huckabee Has Been Misleading On The Issue. "On Fox News Wednesday, he was asked about a bill he supported as governor that would have granted tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants. He suggested that he had only wanted to give such children access to scholarships. 'What I supported was the idea that if a student had been in our Arkansas high schools and had done academically well to be able to compete for an academic challenged scholarship which was meritorious then that student should be able to have the same opportunity as anyone else,' Huckabee said. In fact, the initial bill he supported did have a scholarship provision. But that provision was later stripped out, and was not included in the legislation that Huckabee continued to push. The bill read: 'Any tuition rate that is granted to residents of Arkansas shall be granted on the same terms to all persons, regardless of immigration status, who have attended a secondary educational institution in Arkansas for at least three (3) years and who have either graduated from an Arkansas high school or received a general education diploma in the state.'" (Michael D. Shear, "Rising in Iowa Polls, Huckabee Now In Crosshairs," The Washington Post, http://blog.washingtonpost.com/, Posted 11/15/07)
Let me begin on the one of the far left, which is education. Our schools are falling behind those of other nations - you've seen that. It's true particularly in math and science. Our 15 years olds ranked 24th out of 29 OECD nations in math. 24th out of 29. Our high school seniors rank in the bottom 10% in math and the bottom 25% in science. How can you lead the world if the kids in the next generation are falling behind in the skills they need to innovate and create new enterprises?
But here's the real data: you can see those red dots, you can see there's no relationship at all. As a matter of fact, some of the districts that had the smallest classes had the worst performance on the student scores. And vice versa. And so we decided to spend a little more time talking to teachers and parents and people who'd focused on education - educators and others. And they came up with a list of things that would really make a difference in education. Let me show you some of those.
English immersion: we put this in place in our state, no more bilingual education. We said if you want to be successful in a nation that speaks English, you've got to be fluent in English. We also felt it was critical to measure student performance, put in place a graduation exam, we insisted on school choice, longer school days, parental involvement. Parental involvement means not only a preparatory effort to help our parents get up to snuff, but also to make sure that we do everything we can to have two-parent families. There's nothing like a mom and a dad to help kids be successful in school. These are the ideas that make a real difference in education.
It is the American way that leads to a brighter future for our children, to higher incomes, to a more secure employment, and to a more secure retirement. The American way, tested and proven, is low taxes, open markets, low burdens on employment, excellent education, good healthcare and reliable energy.
So we've got some education to do and we've got some tightening to do, but negotiation and engaging with the Iranians at this point is not the way to go and neither is invading them.
Another aspect of American sovereignty is the security of our borders. The current system is a virtual concrete wall against those who have skill and education, but it's a wide open walk across the border for those that have neither.
Our non-military resources enjoy no such jointness, no such clear leadership, no such clear lines of authority and responsibility. Too often we struggle to integrate our military and civilian instruments of national power into coherent, timely and effective operations. When facing the need to strengthen the democratic underpinnings of a country like Lebanon, our education, health, banking, energy, commerce, law enforcement and diplomatic resources are in separate bureaucracies, all under separate leadership, all protecting their own powers and their own prerogatives. So while we watched, Hezbollah brought healthcare and schools to the Lebanese. Guess who the people followed when conflict ensued? The same thing happened with Hamas and the Palestinians.
It is high time to truly transform our civilian instruments of national power. We need to enable joint strategies and joint operations. Just as the military has divided the world into common regions for all of its branches, so too the civilian agencies should align along consistent boundaries. And one civilian leader, a Deputy lets call him or her, with authority and responsibility for all agencies and departments, must be fully empowered, just like the single military commander for CENTCOM. These Deputies of our civilian resources must have sufficient authority over the activities in their region. They will be heavy hitters, with recognized reputations around the world. They must be given objectives, budgets, and responsible oversight. They will be measured by their success in their region in improving such things as healthcare, education, and economy, and for their progress in promoting peace and democracy.

He currently chairs the K-12 Education Committee and is on the Appropriations and Human Services Committees. During his legislative career he has sponsored bills to lower recidivism and supported efforts to expand abstinence education, counseling and mentoring for young fathers, and a program that encourages churches to assist in the placement of foster children in their communities.
"How must we move to stay ahead, permanently? Raise the bar in education, sharply increase our investment in research and technology, remove the weighty burdens of unnecessary government taxation and regulation, close the plaintiff lawyer's gold mine, and once and for all, actually do what it takes to become energy independent. It makes no sense to send a billion dollars a day out of our economy, often to nations that use it against us."
But this is not about power or politics. It is about sovereignty and security. And it is about fairness. Millions of applicants are waiting to come here legally, to be joined with family members, to bring education and skill that will strengthen our nation, not burden it. Legal immigration is a boon to our nation. We are made a greater nation when immigrants come here legally, seeking opportunity.
" And if you want to see growth in this economy, you keep taxes down, regulation down, you make the cost of doing business low, you invest in technology and education, you let the American people have the incentives to innovate and create new industry. That's why America is so successful." – Governor Romney (CNBC's "Kudlow &amp; Company," 2/7/07)

Governor Romney Will Ensure That The Value Of The Montgomery G.I. Bill Keeps Pace With Rising Educational Expenses. Currently, benefit amounts under the Montgomery G.I. Bill are periodically adjusted by Congress to account for increases in educational costs. But these increases have not kept pace with the rising costs of higher education. Governor Romney will call for a regular outside review of benefits under the Montgomery G.I. Bill to ensure that our veterans, active duty military, and their eligible spouses and dependents have the resources they need to pursue the educational opportunities they deserve.

- SOLUTION #4: Strengthening Our Education System. As President, Governor Romney will emphasize math and science education, while promoting innovative approaches such as charter schools and public-private partnerships, to ensure that our workers have the intellectual capital and skills to compete in the 21st century economy. We should raise the bar in education by setting high standards for our schools, insisting on accountability, and treating teaching as a true profession.
- SOLUTION #5: Creating Worker Empowerment And Training Accounts. These self-managed accounts will give workers the opportunity to take control of their own futures by getting the training and education they need to succeed in the new economy. The accounts may be used for a broad variety of different training and educational opportunities, including those provided by community colleges or businesses that hire these workers.
- SOLUTION #6: Streamlining And Enhancing Access To Worker Training And Educational Programs. Governor Romney will initiate an audit of all existing worker training and educational programs to ensure that workers are being helped most efficiently, while eliminating duplicative spending and minimizing bureaucratic overhead. He will also create true "one-stop-shops" that make it easier for workers to get access to the benefits, training, and educational opportunities they need to find jobs in the new economy.
"Tonight, Governor Romney spoke to the important issues confronting America today. Governor Romney believes that we all benefit from a Washington that stands for a stronger economy, stronger defense and stronger families. In 2008, our Party will have an important choice and Governor Romney made that choice clear tonight on immigration, health care, education and foreign policy. With Governor Romney's experience, vision and values, we can beat the Democrats and build a stronger America."

"Having earned an MBA from Harvard Business School, founded his own venture capital and investment company, managed the Olympic Games and run a state in which the Legislature is some 85 percent Democratic, Romney understands economic principles, the intricacies of reform in areas such as education and health care, and the essential need to work with the other side. It's reasonable to say the economy and budget of Massachusetts were in dramatically better shape when he left office than when he entered, that the once-troubled 2002 Winter Olympics were transformed into a profitable success under his watch."

Second, we'll turn government workforce training programs that are managed by bureaucrats, into personal accounts that can be managed by the workers themselves so they can gain education at community college or they can pay for on-the-job training in real jobs.
Long term, we're only going to lead the world only if our students coming in now are the best-educated in the world. And you know this, almost every independent group that's looked at our public schools has said that we're falling behind international standards. And their number one prescription time and again – treat teachers like the real professionals they are. Better teachers should be better paid. Teachers should also be evaluated and promoted. And, here's a novel idea, education of our children should come ahead of the interests of the teacher's union.

When I was a boy, the American dream meant a house in the suburbs. The American dream today must mean more than a house. The new American dream should include a strong family, enduring values, excellence in education, dependable and affordable healthcare, secure employment and secure retirement, and a safe and prosperous homeland. It's time to build a new American dream for all Americans.

(Chris Andrews, "Romney Says He Will Help Auto Industry," Lansing State Journal, 4/29/07)
"This university, its students, its alumni and the faculty serve as an example of Dr. Robertson's dedication to strengthening and then nurturing the pillars of this community and our country: education, fellowship, and advancement."
"You cross into the deep waters by driving yourself in your education and in your avocation beyond the safe and comfortable, to reach new insights, to make contributions, to serve.
And third, I think that values also played a role in my campaign success. My opponent said that she would sign a bill in favor of gay marriage. I said that I oppose gay marriage and civil unions. My opponent favored bilingual education in school, remember? I did not. I said that to be successful in America, kids needed to learn the language of America. And as you will surely recall, my opponent wanted to lower the age of consent for an abortion from 18 to 16 - and I said no way.
"How must we move to stay ahead, permanently? Raise the bar in education, sharply increase our investment in research and technology, remove the weighty burdens of unnecessary government taxation and regulation, close the plaintiff lawyer's gold mine, and once and for all, actually do what it takes to become energy independent. It makes no sense to send a billion dollars a day out of our economy, often to nations that use it against us."
Governor Romney: "The current system puts up a concrete wall to the best and brightest, yet those without skill or education are able to walk across the border. We must reform the current immigration laws so we can secure our borders, implement a mandatory biometrically-enabled and tamper-proof documentation and employment-verification system, and increase legal immigration into America." (David Yepsen, Op-Ed, "So Far, Romney's Been Most Impressive Republican," Des Moines Register, 7/11/06)
Governor Romney: "McCain-Kennedy Isn't The Answer." "Another aspect of American sovereignty is the security of our borders. The current system is a virtual concrete wall against those who have skill and education, but it's a wide-open walk across the border for those that have neither. McCain-Kennedy isn't the answer. As governor, I took a very different approach. I authorized our state police to enforce federal immigration laws." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At The Conservative Political Action Conference, Washington, D.C., 3/2/07)
- Governor Romney: "As you know, every time I faced a decision as the Governor that related to human life, I came down on the side of the sanctity of life. I fought to ban cloning. I fought to ban embryo farming. I fought to define life as beginning at conception rather than at implantation. I fought for abstinence education in our schools. I vetoed a so-called emergency contraception bill that gave young girls drugs without prescription, drugs that could be abortive and not just contraceptive. That's my record as your Governor." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At The Massachusetts Citizens For Life Mother's Day Pioneer Valley Dinner, Agawam, Massachusetts, 5/10/07)
Governor Romney: "Well, I like John McCain and he campaigned for me as I pointed out during the debate. There's no particular reason for us to be angry with one another. We just have a differing view on basically one major part of the bill, and that's the idea that all of those that are here illegally today would be able to stay and have permanent residency in this country. And he points to the fact that well, it's going to take them 12 years to get citizenship. Well, that's not the point. The point is they all get to stay and that's something which I think is just unfair to the many, many immigrants who would like to come here to get joined with family members to bring skill and education to our society. We just have an agreement to disagree, and I think the great majority of the Republicans, and I think the entire country that focuses on this, will come to agree that that's just not fair."
And third, we were in the beginnings of a cultural crisis. Social values also played a role in my campaign success. My opponent said she would sign a bill that would sanction same sex marriage. I said that I would oppose gay marriage and civil unions. My opponent favored bilingual education. I did not. I said that to be successful in America, children need to speak the language of America. And my opponent wanted to lower the age of consent for an abortion from 18 to 16 – and I did not.
The implications of the marriage decision quickly went well beyond adult marriage. Efforts were made to change birth certificates by removing 'mother' and 'father' and replacing them with 'parent A' and 'parent B.' I said no to that. And parents of a child in second grade were told that their son is required to listen to the reading of a book called the 'King and the King,' about a prince who marries another prince. The school's rationale was since same sex marriage was legal, the education system should advance the idea.
But this is not about power or politics. It is about sovereignty and security. And it is about fairness. Millions of applicants are waiting to come here legally, to be joined with family members, to bring education and skill that will strengthen our nation, not burden it. Legal immigration is a boon to our nation. We are made a greater nation when immigrants come here legally, seeking opportunity.
In May 2007, Congressional Democrats Proposed A Budget That Raised Taxes And Boosted Spending. "Congressional Democrats yesterday proposed a $2.9 trillion budget plan that seeks to boost spending by $23 billion over the president's request, setting up a confrontation with the White House over funding for education, health care and veterans' services. ... The five-year budget plan ... assumes, for now, that taxes on dividends, stock sales and the income of the wealthiest families would go up in 2011." (Lori Montgomery, "Democrats Make Budget Proposal," The Washington Post, 5/17/07)
"Around the world, our goal should be to employ American strength, courage, fortitude and goodness.

It is time that we apply the things that make America the world's leader to making America a safer, freer, and more prosperous nation. By doing so, we can project America's strength and goodness to the world.
"We teach sex education, but there's no portion of sex education which talks about the advantages of waiting... We're saying let's provide an opportunity for parents and school districts to add abstinence to the curriculum." - Gov. Mitt Romney (Andrea Estes And Tracy Jan, "State Widens Teaching Of Abstinence," The Boston Globe, 4/21/06)
Gov. Romney Fought The Battle To Promote Abstinence Education In The Classroom. "Gov. Mitt Romney today announced that Healthy Futures, a health program that promotes the benefits of abstinence, has been awarded the contract to manage the state's abstinence education program for middle school students."

- The Boston Globe: "It Will Be The First Time That The State Will Spend Federal Abstinence Education Funds In Massachusetts For Classroom Programs." "It will be the first time that the state will spend federal abstinence education funds in Massachusetts for classroom programs.

Sen. Obama Mocked The Issue, Which Previously Came Up In His 2004 Senate Race. "'I remember Alan Keyes ... I remember him using this in his campaign against me,' Obama said in reference to the conservative firebrand who ran against him for the U.S. Senate in 2004. Sex education for kindergarteners had become an issue in his race against Keyes because of Obama's work on the issue as chairman of the health committee in the Illinois state Senate. '"Barack Obama supports teaching sex education to kindergarteners,"' said Obama mimicking Keyes' distinctive style of speech."

CNN's ANDERSON COOPER: "Senator Obama, Mitt Romney has accused you this week of saying that 5-year-old children should be getting sex education. Was he right?" SEN. BARACK OBAMA: "Ironically, this was actually a proposal that he himself said he supported when he was running for governor of Massachusetts. ... I've got a 9-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old daughter. And I want them to know if somebody is doing something wrong to them, encroaching on their privacy, that they should come talk to me or my wife. And we've had that conversation, but not every parent is going to have that conversation with their child, and I think it's important that every child does, to make sure that they're not subject to the sexual predators." (CNN/YouTube, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Charleston, SC, 7/23/07)
- In Fact, Sen. Obama Specifically Called For Sex-Ed In Kindergarten, Which Gov. Romney Did Not Support. "The Romney campaign is saying there is a difference here. Kevin Madden, Romney's national spokesman says, 'Obama specifically advocated sex-ed for small children in kindergarten.' Undaunted today, Romney said the following in South Carolina about Obama: 'Senator Obama is wrong if he thinks science-based sex education has any place in kindergarten.'"

- Governor Romney: "But at the same time, New York City was a sanctuary city. The mayor said, 'Look, if you happen to be illegal, we want you in New York City.' That's exactly the wrong kind of message to send in my view. And I think we ought to cut off some funding - federal funding to cities that call themselves sanctuary cities, that welcome people into their cities who are illegal and who provide benefits to individuals - other than, of course, emergency health care and education." (Fox News' "Fox &amp; Friends," 8/9/07)

Governor Romney Has Outlined A Conservative Blueprint To Strengthen Our Economy. In addition to lowering taxes on the American people and bringing fiscal responsibility to Washington, Governor Romney's economic blueprint includes initiatives to reform the tort system, become energy secure, strengthen our education system and promote trade around the world.
"I also want to put in place a special middle-class savings plan, which has a lot of associated benefits. I want middle-class Americans, and this is 95 percent of Americans who are earning $200,000 a year or less, I want these individuals to be investing in the future, to be saving, to be preparing for their own retirement, their down payment on their home, the education for their kids instead of looking to government for all these things. And to do that, I would propose that middle-income Americans – $200,000 a year or less in income – have a new tax rate on interest, dividends and capital gains, and that tax rate is absolutely zero. And I believe with that kind of change in our tax policy you'll see more savings and more investment in America.
- Streamline And Enhance Access To Worker Training And Educational Programs. Governor Romney will initiate an audit of all existing worker training and educational programs to ensure that workers are being helped most efficiently, while eliminating duplicative spending and minimizing bureaucratic overhead. He will also create true "one-stop-shops" that make it easier for workers to get access to the benefits, training, and educational opportunities they need to find jobs in the new economy.
- Create Worker Empowerment And Training Accounts. These self-managed accounts will give workers the opportunity to take control of their own futures by getting the training and education they need to succeed in the new economy. The accounts may be used for a broad variety of different training and educational opportunities, including those provided by community colleges or businesses that hire these workers. Best of all, these accounts will take money out of the hands of bureaucrats and put it into the hands of those who really need it – displaced workers.

"Today, our economy faces unprecedented challenges from abroad. Maintaining our competitiveness will demand a commitment from Washington to cut the tax and regulatory burdens, better our education system, make health care more affordable and accessible and end our dependence on foreign oil," said Governor Romney. "This group of men and women bring a wealth of experience from the public and private sectors. They know what needs to be done to build a more competitive economy because they have experience doing it."
"I have had an opportunity to look at the records of other candidates, and it is clear that Governor Romney is the candidate with the most impressive record of accomplishment in the public and private sectors and the strongest record of enforcing our immigration laws," said Sheriff Hunter. "As Governor of Massachusetts, he worked with the federal government to allow Massachusetts state troopers to enforce federal immigration laws, vetoed in-state tuition at public colleges and universities for illegal immigrants, promoted English immersion in the education system and opposed driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. I am proud to endorse Governor Romney for President of the United States and know his conservative leadership will steer our country in the right direction."

- Governor Romney Believes Our Education System Works Best When We Have More Local Control Of Our Schools. While there is a proper role for the federal government to play in education, it is not in telling parents, teachers, kids and local authorities what to teach or how to run their schools.
Governor Romney Will Promote School Choice. He believes that when parents and kids are free to choose their school, everyone benefits. That's because competition and choice in educational opportunities – whether it comes from private schools, charter schools, or home schooling – makes traditional public schools better and improves the quality of education for all of America's kids. Governor Romney believes that it is especially important that students in failing schools be able to exercise school choice so that they can get access to the resources and opportunities they need to succeed.
- Governor Romney Has Proposed A Federal Home Schooling Tax Credit. As of 2003, there were nearly 1.1 million home schooled students in the United States. Governor Romney believes that parents who want to home school their kids should be able to do so. To help them, he will provide a tax credit to help defray the educational expenses of parents who home school their kids.
Governor Romney Promoted Parental Involvement In Education. Because parents are crucial to a child's success in school, Governor Romney supported measures to empower parents to play a more active role in their kids' educations.

Governor Romney Will Ensure That The Value Of The Montgomery G.I. Bill Keeps Pace With Rising Educational Expenses. Currently, benefit amounts under the Montgomery G.I. Bill are periodically adjusted by Congress to account for increases in educational costs. But these increases have not kept pace with the rising costs of higher education. Governor Romney will call for a regular outside review of benefits under the Montgomery G.I. Bill to ensure that our veterans, active duty military, and their eligible spouses and dependents have the resources they need to pursue the educational opportunities they deserve.
Governor Romney: "Here's what you do. First of all, if they're going to give driver's licenses to them, you say, you know what, we're going to cut back on federal highway funds to any state that gives driver's licenses to illegals. Number two, if you have a state like Mike Huckabee's state in Arkansas that fights to give people a tuition break if they're an illegal in their state, you say no, you're not going to do that. If you do that, we're going to cut back on higher education funding. And number three, if you have a city like Mayor Giuliani's city, New York City, that says that it's a sanctuary city, they're going to provide benefits to people that come here illegally, you say, we're going to cut back on federal funding to those cities as well. We can end the magnets that draw people here illegally – illegal employment by having an employment verification system, the sanctuary state of mind which you see in sanctuary cities, sanctuary tuition breaks, sanctuary driver's licenses. All these things are bad ideas and the American people are going to speak so loud and clear on this issue it's going to get done."

Gov. Romney Was Able To Govern Successfully In The Bluest Of Blue States. "But I think the most important element of my having been successful in Massachusetts is not just showing that I was able to win a Democrat state, but that I was able to work with Democrat legislators, and to find enough common ground to balance their budget every four years without raising taxes, to put in place a health care system that is private, market based, to make important reforms to our education system, to make important reforms to our transportation system...that I was able to work across the aisle." (M.E. Sprengelmeyer, "Back Roads Interview With Mitt Romney," Rocky Mountain News, 8/2/07)
Governor Romney Will Work To Better Schools And Better Education For Our Children. Governor Romney believes in school choice and that every child should have an equal opportunity to have a good education.
"Today, the Giuliani campaign is continuing their negative personal attacks. Governor Romney is the only candidate in this race who has brought Republicans and Democrats together to achieve great results for the people they represent. Under Governor Romney, we passed tax cuts, achieved health care reform and improved our education system. Jim Rappaport's attacks on Governor Romney are nothing more than sour grapes from a candidate passed over in 2002 for the Republican Lt. Governor nomination."
Former Secretary Of Education Bill Bennett: "Mitt Romney talked about education as the next civil right...Liberals have failed inner city blacks overwhelmingly in the last 30 years. That's why the question from the father and son was so pertinent and I thought Romney did a good job on it." (CNN's "Post Debate Coverage," 11/28/07)

"CUNY's policy of charging illegal immigrants the lower rate reflected the city's historic embrace of immigrants and conformed to a policy laid out by Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1989 and reaffirmed by Mayors David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani. In reviewing the policy, Mr. Schaffer came across a brief section of a 1996 immigration law that said illegal immigrants should not be eligible for educational benefits not available to American citizens from other states, CUNY officials said. When the law was passed, CUNY lawyers reviewed it and decided that the university should not make changes until regulations were issued to carry out the law. Mr. Schaffer said he concluded, however, that at this point the university had no choice but to change its tuition policy." (Karen W. Arenson, "CUNY Raises Tuition Rates For Foreigners Here Illegally," The New York Times, 11/3/01)
The Washington Post Recently Noted That Huckabee Has Been Misleading On The Issue. "On Fox News Wednesday, he was asked about a bill he supported as governor that would have granted tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants. He suggested that he had only wanted to give such children access to scholarships. 'What I supported was the idea that if a student had been in our Arkansas high schools and had done academically well to be able to compete for an academic challenged scholarship which was meritorious then that student should be able to have the same opportunity as anyone else,' Huckabee said. In fact, the initial bill he supported did have a scholarship provision. But that provision was later stripped out, and was not included in the legislation that Huckabee continued to push. The bill read: 'Any tuition rate that is granted to residents of Arkansas shall be granted on the same terms to all persons, regardless of immigration status, who have attended a secondary educational institution in Arkansas for at least three (3) years and who have either graduated from an Arkansas high school or received a general education diploma in the state.'"

"When I am on the campaign trail, I am often asked where I would focus my attention as first lady. I would not only help raise awareness for diseases like multiple sclerosis, but I would also continue my work with young people. I will focus on helping at-risk youth make the right choices — for example, staying in school, being drug free, promoting abstinence education and promoting marriage before having children.

- SOLUTION #4: Strengthening Our Education System. As President, Governor Romney will emphasize math and science education, while promoting innovative approaches such as charter schools and public-private partnerships, to ensure that our workers have the intellectual capital and skills to compete in the 21st century economy. We should raise the bar in education by setting high standards for our schools, insisting on accountability, and treating teaching as a true profession.
- SOLUTION #5: Creating Worker Empowerment And Training Accounts. These self-managed accounts will give workers the opportunity to take control of their own futures by getting the training and education they need to succeed in the new economy. The accounts may be used for a broad variety of different training and educational opportunities, including those provided by community colleges or businesses that hire these workers.
- SOLUTION #6: Streamlining And Enhancing Access To Worker Training And Educational Programs. Governor Romney will initiate an audit of all existing worker training and educational programs to ensure that workers are being helped most efficiently, while eliminating duplicative spending and minimizing bureaucratic overhead. He will also create true "one-stop-shops" that make it easier for workers to get access to the benefits, training, and educational opportunities they need to find jobs in the new economy.
"Tonight, Governor Romney spoke to the important issues confronting America today. Governor Romney believes that we all benefit from a Washington that stands for a stronger economy, stronger defense and stronger families. In 2008, our Party will have an important choice and Governor Romney made that choice clear tonight on immigration, health care, education and foreign policy. With Governor Romney's experience, vision and values, we can beat the Democrats and build a stronger America."

"I am proud to have her on my team, and look forward to working with her to strengthen families in Michigan, and across our nation."
Governor Romney Will Ensure That The Value Of The Montgomery G.I. Bill Keeps Pace With Rising Educational Expenses. Currently, benefit amounts under the Montgomery G.I. Bill are periodically adjusted by Congress to account for increases in educational costs. But these increases have not kept pace with rising higher education costs. Governor Romney will call for a regular outside review of Montgomery G.I. Bill benefits to ensure that our veterans, active duty military, and their eligible spouses and dependents have the resources they need to pursue the opportunities they deserve.
"Having earned an MBA from Harvard Business School, founded his own venture capital and investment company, managed the Olympic Games and run a state in which the Legislature is some 85 percent Democratic, Romney understands economic principles, the intricacies of reform in areas such as education and health care, and the essential need to work with the other side. It's reasonable to say the economy and budget of Massachusetts were in dramatically better shape when he left office than when he entered, that the once-troubled 2002 Winter Olympics were transformed into a profitable success under his watch."
- Under Governor Huckabee, State Spending More Than Doubled From $6.6 Billion To $16.1 Billion. "During Huckabee's 10 years as governor, state spending more than doubled, from $6.6 billion to $16.1 billion in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006. Higher education and public schools got big increases, as did social services." (Daniel Nasaw, "Home Turf Not Rock Solid For Huckabee," Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, 10/4/07)
"Both the economy and the budget in Massachusetts were in better shape at the end of Romney's term than at the beginning, and the state had made significant strides in the areas of education and health care.

Second, we'll turn government workforce training programs that are managed by bureaucrats, into personal accounts that can be managed by the workers themselves so they can gain education at community college or they can pay for on-the-job training in real jobs.
Long term, we're only going to lead the world only if our students coming in now are the best-educated in the world. And you know this, almost every independent group that's looked at our public schools has said that we're falling behind international standards. And their number one prescription time and again – treat teachers like the real professionals they are. Better teachers should be better paid. Teachers should also be evaluated and promoted. And, here's a novel idea, education of our children should come ahead of the interests of the teacher's union.
The Detroit News Noted That The Bush Tax Cuts Benefited The Middle Class. "Opponents of tax relief claimed it would primarily benefit the wealthy. But a number of measures in the bill, including marriage penalty relief, increased child and education credits, an expansion of the 15 percent bracket and a new 10 percent bracket, will provide relief to lower- and middle-income earners that is larger proportionately than their share of the tax bill." (Editorial, "Tax Cuts: A Very Good Start," The Detroit News, 5/28/01)

America understands that Washington has promised that they'd secure our borders, but they haven't. Washington told us that they would live by high ethical standards, but they haven't. Washington told us that they'd fix Social Security, but they haven't. Washington told us they'd get us better health care and better education, but they haven't. Washington told us they'd get us a tax break for middle income Americans, but they haven't. Washington told us that they'd cut back on the earmarks and the pork-barrel spending, but they haven't. And Washington told us they'd reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but they haven't. And who's going to get the job done? We are!
And what we're going to see in the next few days is Democrats saying that they're the party of change. You're going to hear Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and John Edwards saying that they're the party of change. And I think they would bring change to America, just not the kind we want. I think they take their inspiration from the Europe of old: big government, big brother, big taxes. They fundamentally in their hearts believe that America is great because we have a great government, and we do have a great government, but that's not what makes us the best nation, the strongest nation, the greatest nation on Earth. What makes us such a great nation is the American people. I take my inspiration from Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush, who took their inspiration from the American people – hard-working American people, people who believed in opportunity, who loved education, God-fearing people, people who also love their families, people deeply patriotic. It is that characteristic of the American people that makes us the most powerful nation on Earth. Ronald Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush said we are a great and good people, it's exactly what we are. It's why we will always be the most powerful nation on Earth.
Today, In South Carolina, Governor Romney Will Discuss His Strategy To Strengthen Our Economy And Make America More Globally Competitive. America's economy faces unprecedented challenges both here at home and abroad. For decades, Washington has talked about strengthening America in this ever-changing global economy. Yet, little has happened. As President, Governor Romney will bring change to Washington. He will take action to build a stronger economy by lowering taxes, enhancing our competitiveness and improving education.

Governor Romney Will Strengthen Our Schools. Improving our schools is critical to the future of our country and our economy. Governor Romney also believes that closing the achievement gap in our schools is the civil rights issue of our time. To raise the bar in education, Governor Romney will:
- Propose A Federal Home Schooling Tax Credit. Governor Romney believes that parents who want to home school their kids should be able to do so, and to help them, he will provide a tax credit to help defray the educational expenses of parents who home school their kids.
- Ensure Our Kids Get The Education They Need To Excel In The Jobs Of The New Economy. As President, Governor Romney will emphasize math and science education, while promoting innovative approaches such as charter schools and public-private partnerships, to ensure that our workers have the intellectual capital and skills to compete in the 21st century economy.
"His 'strategy for a stronger America' promises to lower taxes while improving education and making our nation more competitive in the global marketplace. He also understands the threat America faces from jihadists in the Middle East, and proposes a 'Marshall Plan' to unify moderate Muslims against terrorism at its source." ...
"On this day, we honor the vision and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who devoted his life to fulfilling the truth revealed at our nation's founding that all men are created equal. He proved that one man with a dream can make a difference. While we have made great strides, there is still much work to be done to ensure all Americans prosper economically, have access to affordable health care, and receive a quality education. The failure of our inner city schools is the great civil rights issue of our time.
Ander Crenshaw Currently Represents Florida's Fourth Congressional District In The United States House of Representatives. Congressman Crenshaw was first elected to Congress on November 7, 2000. Since his election, he has worked hard to make Northeast Florida neighborhoods safer, strengthen our military, improve education and provide tax relief.
Background On Senator Thad Cochran:
Senator Thad Cochran Has Represented Mississippi In The United States Senate Since 1978. First elected to the Senate in 1978, Senator Cochran was the first Republican in over 100 years to win statewide election in Mississippi. In 2002, he was re-elected to his fifth term with 85 percent of the vote. Senator Cochran currently serves as Ranking Member of the full Appropriations Committee and the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. He also serves as a member of Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee and the Rules Committee. His record includes the sponsorship of the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, legislation supporting education programs and action to aid the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina. Before his election to the U.S. Senate, Senator Cochran served in the U.S. House of Representatives. He and his wife, the former Rose Clayton of New Albany, Mississippi, have two children and three grandchildren.
"The former venture-capital company CEO and rescuer of the 2002 Winter Olympics also worked with the Democratic legislature to stop job losses and reduce a projected $3 billion budget shortfall. He managed to balance his state's budget without sales or income tax or gas increases. And he streamlined other government agencies - all while maintaining the state's huge accomplishments from a decade of education reforms that put Massachusetts ahead of Connecticut on many academic achievement scores.
Many of the people across our country are worried about their retirement accounts. They wonder if they can pay for the college education of their child. They see their largest asset, their home value, dropping. Some wonder if their job is going to be secure in a new global economy. Americans wonder how they can afford the rising cost of health care, and gasoline, and taxes. These are real challenges. At a time like this, America needs a president in the White House who has actually had a job in the real economy.
In making the announcement, Governor Romney said, "I'm glad to have the support of so many conservative leaders in New Jersey. People all over the country are concerned about the uncertainty in the economy, and I have the experience and the plan to keep our economy strong. I believe we need to cut personal and corporate taxes, improve education and make health care more accessible. I look forward to working with these leaders to make sure we earn the support of as many New Jersey voters as possible leading up to the February 5 primary and beyond."
Let me begin on the one of the far left, which is education. Our schools are falling behind those of other nations - you've seen that. It's true particularly in math and science. Our 15 years olds ranked 24th out of 29 OECD nations in math. 24th out of 29. Our high school seniors rank in the bottom 10% in math and the bottom 25% in science. How can you lead the world if the kids in the next generation are falling behind in the skills they need to innovate and create new enterprises?
But here's the real data: you can see those red dots, you can see there's no relationship at all. As a matter of fact, some of the districts that had the smallest classes had the worst performance on the student scores. And vice versa. And so we decided to spend a little more time talking to teachers and parents and people who'd focused on education - educators and others. And they came up with a list of things that would really make a difference in education. Let me show you some of those.
English immersion: we put this in place in our state, no more bilingual education. We said if you want to be successful in a nation that speaks English, you've got to be fluent in English. We also felt it was critical to measure student performance, put in place a graduation exam, we insisted on school choice, longer school days, parental involvement. Parental involvement means not only a preparatory effort to help our parents get up to snuff, but also to make sure that we do everything we can to have two-parent families. There's nothing like a mom and a dad to help kids be successful in school. These are the ideas that make a real difference in education.
It is the American way that leads to a brighter future for our children, to higher incomes, to a more secure employment, and to a more secure retirement. The American way, tested and proven, is low taxes, open markets, low burdens on employment, excellent education, good healthcare and reliable energy.
When I was a boy, the American dream meant a house in the suburbs. The American dream today must mean more than a house. The new American dream should include a strong family, enduring values, excellence in education, dependable and affordable healthcare, secure employment and secure retirement, and a safe and prosperous homeland. It's time to build a new American dream for all Americans.
So we've got some education to do and we've got some tightening to do, but negotiation and engaging with the Iranians at this point is not the way to go and neither is invading them.
Our non-military resources enjoy no such jointness, no such clear leadership, no such clear lines of authority and responsibility. Too often we struggle to integrate our military and civilian instruments of national power into coherent, timely and effective operations. When facing the need to strengthen the democratic underpinnings of a country like Lebanon, our education, health, banking, energy, commerce, law enforcement and diplomatic resources are in separate bureaucracies, all under separate leadership, all protecting their own powers and their own prerogatives. So while we watched, Hezbollah brought healthcare and schools to the Lebanese. Guess who the people followed when conflict ensued? The same thing happened with Hamas and the Palestinians.
It is high time to truly transform our civilian instruments of national power. We need to enable joint strategies and joint operations. Just as the military has divided the world into common regions for all of its branches, so too the civilian agencies should align along consistent boundaries. And one civilian leader, a Deputy lets call him or her, with authority and responsibility for all agencies and departments, must be fully empowered, just like the single military commander for CENTCOM. These Deputies of our civilian resources must have sufficient authority over the activities in their region. They will be heavy hitters, with recognized reputations around the world. They must be given objectives, budgets, and responsible oversight. They will be measured by their success in their region in improving such things as healthcare, education, and economy, and for their progress in promoting peace and democracy.
But this is not about power or politics. It is about sovereignty and security. And it is about fairness. Millions of applicants are waiting to come here legally, to be joined with family members, to bring education and skill that will strengthen our nation, not burden it. Legal immigration is a boon to our nation. We are made a greater nation when immigrants come here legally, seeking opportunity.
In May 2007, Congressional Democrats Proposed A Budget That Raised Taxes And Boosted Spending. "Congressional Democrats yesterday proposed a $2.9 trillion budget plan that seeks to boost spending by $23 billion over the president's request, setting up a confrontation with the White House over funding for education, health care and veterans' services. ... The five-year budget plan ... assumes, for now, that taxes on dividends, stock sales and the income of the wealthiest families would go up in 2011." (Lori Montgomery, "Democrats Make Budget Proposal," The Washington Post, 5/17/07)
But Sen. Barack Obama Supports Sex Education For Kindergarteners, And Wrongly Claimed That Gov. Mitt Romney Does, Too. CNN's ANDERSON COOPER: "Senator Obama, Mitt Romney has accused you this week of saying that 5-year-old children should be getting sex education. Was he right?" SEN. BARACK OBAMA: "Ironically, this was actually a proposal that he himself said he supported when he was running for governor of Massachusetts. ... I've got a 9-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old daughter. And I want them to know if somebody is doing something wrong to them, encroaching on their privacy, that they should come talk to me or my wife. And we've had that conversation, but not every parent is going to have that conversation with their child, and I think it's important that every child does, to make sure that they're not subject to the sexual predators." (CNN/YouTube, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Charleston, SC, 7/23/07)
- In Fact, Sen. Obama Specifically Called For Sex-Ed In Kindergarten, Which Gov. Romney Did Not Support. "The Romney campaign is saying there is a difference here. Kevin Madden, Romney's national spokesman says, 'Obama specifically advocated sex-ed for small children in kindergarten.' Undaunted today, Romney said the following in South Carolina about Obama: 'Senator Obama is wrong if he thinks science-based sex education has any place in kindergarten.'"

Gov. Romney Was Able To Govern Successfully In The Bluest Of Blue States. "But I think the most important element of my having been successful in Massachusetts is not just showing that I was able to win a Democrat state, but that I was able to work with Democrat legislators, and to find enough common ground to balance their budget every four years without raising taxes, to put in place a health care system that is private, market based, to make important reforms to our education system, to make important reforms to our transportation system...that I was able to work across the aisle." (M.E. Sprengelmeyer, "Back Roads Interview With Mitt Romney," Rocky Mountain News, 8/2/07)
Second, we'll turn government workforce training programs that are managed by bureaucrats, into personal accounts that can be managed by the workers themselves so they can gain education at community college or they can pay for on-the-job training in real jobs.
Long term, we're only going to lead the world only if our students coming in now are the best-educated in the world. And you know this, almost every independent group that's looked at our public schools has said that we're falling behind international standards. And their number one prescription time and again – treat teachers like the real professionals they are. Better teachers should be better paid. Teachers should also be evaluated and promoted. And, here's a novel idea, education of our children should come ahead of the interests of the teacher's union.
Governor Romney Will Create Worker Empowerment And Training Accounts. These self-managed accounts will give workers the opportunity to take control of their own futures by getting the training and education they need to succeed in the new economy.
Governor Romney Will Streamline And Enhance Access To Worker Training And Educational Programs. Governor Romney will initiate an audit of all existing worker training and educational programs to ensure that workers are being helped most efficiently, while eliminating duplicative spending and minimizing bureaucratic overhead.
Governor Romney Will Strengthen Our Education System. As President, Governor Romney will emphasize math and science education, while promoting innovative approaches such as charter schools and public-private partnerships, to ensure that our workers have the intellectual capital and skills to compete in the 21st century economy. Governor Romney will also treat teachers like the real professionals they are. Better teachers should receive better pay while being evaluation and promoted.

Governor Romney Will Strengthen Our Education System. As President, Governor Romney will emphasize math and science education, while promoting innovative approaches such as charter schools and public-private partnerships. To ensure our education system prepares our children for a new generation of challenges, Governor Romney will:
- Promote School Choice. He believes that when parents and kids are free to choose their school, everyone benefits. That's because competition and choice in educational opportunities – whether it comes from private schools, charter schools, or home schooling – makes traditional public schools better and improves the quality of education for all of America's kids.
- Propose A Federal Home Schooling Tax Credit. As of 2003, there were nearly 1.1 million home schooled students in the United States. Governor Romney believes that parents who want to home school their kids should be able to do so. To help them, he will provide a tax credit to help defray the educational expenses of parents who home school their kids.
- Believe Our Education System Works Best When We Have More Local Control Of Our Schools. While there is a proper role for the federal government to play in education, it is not in telling parents, teachers, kids and local authorities what to teach or how to run their schools.
My father made the most of opportunities that came before him, and by the time I came along — I was the fourth of four brothers and sisters — I had the chance to get the education my dad couldn't.
By their very nature, taxes reduce our freedom. Their only role in a free economy should be to fund services that are absolutely essential, such as national security, education, and the care of those who cannot care for themselves.
So we've got some education to do and we've got some tightening to do, but negotiation and engaging with the Iranians at this point is not the way to go and neither is invading them.
Another aspect of American sovereignty is the security of our borders. The current system is a virtual concrete wall against those who have skill and education, but it's a wide open walk across the border for those that have neither.
Governor Romney: "The current system puts up a concrete wall to the best and brightest, yet those without skill or education are able to walk across the border. We must reform the current immigration laws so we can secure our borders, implement a mandatory biometrically-enabled and tamper-proof documentation and employment-verification system, and increase legal immigration into America." (David Yepsen, Op-Ed, "So Far, Romney's Been Most Impressive Republican," Des Moines Register, 7/11/06)
Governor Romney: "McCain-Kennedy Isn't The Answer." "Another aspect of American sovereignty is the security of our borders. The current system is a virtual concrete wall against those who have skill and education, but it's a wide-open walk across the border for those that have neither. McCain-Kennedy isn't the answer. As governor, I took a very different approach. I authorized our state police to enforce federal immigration laws." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At The Conservative Political Action Conference, Washington, D.C., 3/2/07)
- Governor Romney: "As you know, every time I faced a decision as the Governor that related to human life, I came down on the side of the sanctity of life. I fought to ban cloning. I fought to ban embryo farming. I fought to define life as beginning at conception rather than at implantation. I fought for abstinence education in our schools. I vetoed a so-called emergency contraception bill that gave young girls drugs without prescription, drugs that could be abortive and not just contraceptive. That's my record as your Governor." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At The Massachusetts Citizens For Life Mother's Day Pioneer Valley Dinner, Agawam, Massachusetts, 5/10/07)
Governor Romney: "Well, I like John McCain and he campaigned for me as I pointed out during the debate. There's no particular reason for us to be angry with one another. We just have a differing view on basically one major part of the bill, and that's the idea that all of those that are here illegally today would be able to stay and have permanent residency in this country. And he points to the fact that well, it's going to take them 12 years to get citizenship. Well, that's not the point. The point is they all get to stay and that's something which I think is just unfair to the many, many immigrants who would like to come here to get joined with family members to bring skill and education to our society. We just have an agreement to disagree, and I think the great majority of the Republicans, and I think the entire country that focuses on this, will come to agree that that's just not fair."
But this is not about power or politics. It is about sovereignty and security. And it is about fairness. Millions of applicants are waiting to come here legally, to be joined with family members, to bring education and skill that will strengthen our nation, not burden it. Legal immigration is a boon to our nation. We are made a greater nation when immigrants come here legally, seeking opportunity.
- Governor Romney: "But at the same time, New York City was a sanctuary city. The mayor said, 'Look, if you happen to be illegal, we want you in New York City.' That's exactly the wrong kind of message to send in my view. And I think we ought to cut off some funding - federal funding to cities that call themselves sanctuary cities, that welcome people into their cities who are illegal and who provide benefits to individuals - other than, of course, emergency health care and education." (Fox News' "Fox &amp; Friends," 8/9/07)
" And if you want to see growth in this economy, you keep taxes down, regulation down, you make the cost of doing business low, you invest in technology and education, you let the American people have the incentives to innovate and create new industry. That's why America is so successful." – Governor Romney (CNBC's "Kudlow &amp; Company," 2/7/07)
Unlike Other Republican Candidates, Governor Romney Does Not Support Sanctuary City Policies And Opposes Amnesty. GOVERNOR ROMNEY: "But at the same time, New York City was a sanctuary city. The mayor said, 'Look, if you happen to be illegal, we want you in New York City.' That's exactly the wrong kind of message to send in my view. And I think we ought to cut off some funding – federal funding to cities that call themselves sanctuary cities, that welcome people into their cities who are illegal and who provide benefits to individuals – other than, of course, emergency health care and education." (Fox News' "Fox &amp; Friends," 8/9/07)
"I have had an opportunity to look at the records of other candidates, and it is clear that Governor Romney is the candidate with the most impressive record of accomplishment in the public and private sectors and the strongest record of enforcing our immigration laws," said Sheriff Hunter. "As Governor of Massachusetts, he worked with the federal government to allow Massachusetts state troopers to enforce federal immigration laws, vetoed in-state tuition at public colleges and universities for illegal immigrants, promoted English immersion in the education system and opposed driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. I am proud to endorse Governor Romney for President of the United States and know his conservative leadership will steer our country in the right direction."

Former Secretary Of Education Bill Bennett: "Mitt Romney talked about education as the next civil right...Liberals have failed inner city blacks overwhelmingly in the last 30 years.

Giuliani Reaffirmed CUNY's Policy Of Giving In-State Tuition To Illegal Immigrants When He Renewed New York's Sanctuary Policy. "CUNY's policy of charging illegal immigrants the lower rate reflected the city's historic embrace of immigrants and conformed to a policy laid out by Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1989 and reaffirmed by Mayors David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani. In reviewing the policy, Mr. Schaffer came across a brief section of a 1996 immigration law that said illegal immigrants should not be eligible for educational benefits not available to American citizens from other states, CUNY officials said. When the law was passed, CUNY lawyers reviewed it and decided that the university should not make changes until regulations were issued to carry out the law. Mr. Schaffer said he concluded, however, that at this point the university had no choice but to change its tuition policy." (Karen W. Arenson, "CUNY Raises Tuition Rates For Foreigners Here Illegally," The New York Times, 11/3/01)
The Washington Post Recently Noted That Huckabee Has Been Misleading On The Issue. "On Fox News Wednesday, he was asked about a bill he supported as governor that would have granted tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants. He suggested that he had only wanted to give such children access to scholarships. 'What I supported was the idea that if a student had been in our Arkansas high schools and had done academically well to be able to compete for an academic challenged scholarship which was meritorious then that student should be able to have the same opportunity as anyone else,' Huckabee said. In fact, the initial bill he supported did have a scholarship provision. But that provision was later stripped out, and was not included in the legislation that Huckabee continued to push. The bill read: 'Any tuition rate that is granted to residents of Arkansas shall be granted on the same terms to all persons, regardless of immigration status, who have attended a secondary educational institution in Arkansas for at least three (3) years and who have either graduated from an Arkansas high school or received a general education diploma in the state.'"

- SOLUTION #4: Strengthening Our Education System. As President, Governor Romney will emphasize math and science education, while promoting innovative approaches such as charter schools and public-private partnerships, to ensure that our workers have the intellectual capital and skills to compete in the 21st century economy. We should raise the bar in education by setting high standards for our schools, insisting on accountability, and treating teaching as a true profession.
- SOLUTION #5: Creating Worker Empowerment And Training Accounts. These self-managed accounts will give workers the opportunity to take control of their own futures by getting the training and education they need to succeed in the new economy. The accounts may be used for a broad variety of different training and educational opportunities, including those provided by community colleges or businesses that hire these workers.
- SOLUTION #6: Streamlining And Enhancing Access To Worker Training And Educational Programs. Governor Romney will initiate an audit of all existing worker training and educational programs to ensure that workers are being helped most efficiently, while eliminating duplicative spending and minimizing bureaucratic overhead. He will also create true "one-stop-shops" that make it easier for workers to get access to the benefits, training, and educational opportunities they need to find jobs in the new economy.
"Tonight, Governor Romney spoke to the important issues confronting America today. Governor Romney believes that we all benefit from a Washington that stands for a stronger economy, stronger defense and stronger families. In 2008, our Party will have an important choice and Governor Romney made that choice clear tonight on immigration, health care, education and foreign policy. With Governor Romney's experience, vision and values, we can beat the Democrats and build a stronger America."

Let's start with taxes. By their very nature, they reduce our freedom. Their only role in a free economy should be to fund services that are absolutely essential, such as national security, education, and the care of those who cannot care for themselves.
