Macranger: "Romney is masterful. Handled Wallace's questions about gun control, abortion with ease." (Macranger, "Read My lips," Heading Right, http://headingright.com, 5/15/07)
- Governor Romney Believes The Second Amendment Is About More Than Just Self-Defense Or Sport; It's About The Basic Freedom Of Lawful Citizens To Live Their Lives. The Second Amendment was enshrined by the Founding Fathers in our Constitution and our Bill of Rights to protect the rights of our citizens to own firearms. Bumper sticker gun control does not protect the individual but instead takes away protections and penalizes law-abiding citizens. Criminals do not buy guns in stores nor subject themselves to background checks. Law-abiding citizens certainly have a right to protect their homes and their families.
"I believe that any discussion regarding firearms and crime control must focus on the criminal. Unfortunately, many in Washington believe that restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners will diminish violent crime. They are wrong. Over the years, the idea that it is possible to curtail crime by banning firearms has run up against a mountain of empirical evidence that forces one to conclude that gun control laws fail because they rely on the cooperation of a very unlikely element – the criminal. Any measure that fails to focus on the criminal and infringes on the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans will be a non-starter for me.

National Review's Ramesh Ponnuru: Mayor Giuliani "Is No Judicial Conservative." "Giuliani on the Line-Item Veto... This guy is no judicial conservative. I don't agree with him on gun control or the commuter tax or the 1996 welfare reform, but what's more troubling is that he went to court to get the policy he wanted each and every time. He says he's a 'strict constructionist' now, but again and again he has invited judges to be activist. And he hasn't repudiated any of that record."
