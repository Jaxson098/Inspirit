And I know a lot of conservatives who disagree with me on that. On immigration, for instance, I think everybody who's not a legal resident of this country should have a card, an identification card. Some people don't like that idea.
Nashua Telegraph Columnist Jennifer Horn: "Without doubt former MA Gov Mitt Romney was the winner by every scale. He was the most presidential of all, and not just in the way he combed his hair. He was clear, decisive, firm and unwavering. He was strong on defense, abortion, immigration, healthcare and the economy. He was likeable, respectful of the other candidates and set the tone for the entire debate." (Jennifer Horn, "First GOP Debate," Jennifer Horn Online, 5/4/07)

- Mayor Giuliani Recently Claimed His Sanctuary Policies Protecting Illegals Immigrants Were "The Most Successful." "Back on track regarding the subject of illegal immigration Giuliani said, 'The policies that I utilized with regard to illegal immigration (in New York City) were, in the context of overall policies, probably were the most successful in the history of the country in creating an orderly, legal, lawful society.'"

- Huckabee Has Been Called "A Treacherous Liberal On Taxes, Social Welfare Spending And Illegal Immigration." "Mr. Minton voices the concerns of many conservatives that while Mr. Huckabee governed as a social conservative in opposing abortion and same-sex 'marriage,' he was a treacherous liberal on taxes, social welfare spending and illegal immigration." (Ralph Z. Hallow, "Huckabee Stirs Up Third Party Fear," The Washington Times, 10/29/07)
In An Editorial, The [Arkansas] Leader Called Huckabee "One Of The Most Liberal Governor's In Arkansas History." "His record has been both Huckabee's strength and his Achilles' heel, as we have had occasion to observe. He is one of the most liberal governors in Arkansas history, having accounted for more tax increases than any other and having enlarged state government more than any other. He has exorbitantly inflated his record as a tax-cutter on the stump and now that will catch up with him. But we continue to believe that if he will shoot straight with the Republican constituencies, his record and his moderate views on such things as immigration and government health assistance could make him the party's best opponent to Sen. Hillary Clinton, the expected Democratic nominee. That is not the conventional wisdom, but it will be his best pitch." (Editorial, "Huck Keeps Moving Up," The [Arkansas] Leader, 10/31/07)
Boston, MA – Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, "Choice: The Record." The ad highlights the very important choice voters will have to make when it comes to confronting illegal immigration. While Governors Romney and Huckabee both believe in protecting life and traditional marriage, they have very different records on enforcing our immigration laws. In Massachusetts, Governor Romney stood up and vetoed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants and opposed driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. In Arkansas, Governor Huckabee supported in-state tuition breaks and taxpayer-funded scholarships for illegal immigrants.
"On immigration, the choice matters."
- Governor Romney Vetoed In-State Tuition For Illegal Immigrants. "Mr. Romney also cut several outside sections, including a plan that would allow illegal aliens to pay in-state tuition rates at state colleges and universities; he said the plan would encourage illegal immigration." (Shaun Sutner, "Romney Approves $22.5B Budget," Telegram &amp; Gazette, 6/26/04)
"Our guiding principle has always been to select the most conservative viable candidate. In our judgment, that candidate is Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. Unlike some other candidates in the race, Romney is a full-spectrum conservative: a supporter of free-market economics and limited government, moral causes such as the right to life and the preservation of marriage, and a foreign policy based on the national interest. While he has not talked much about the importance of resisting ethnic balkanization – none of the major candidates has – he supports enforcing the immigration laws and opposes amnesty. Those are important steps in the right direction."
Governor Romney Will Enforce Our Laws And Reform Our Immigration System. America's immigration system is broken, but for too long all our leaders in Washington have done is talk about ending illegal immigration. Governor Romney believes we must enforce and reform our immigration laws so that we can end illegal immigration. To end illegal immigration, Governor Romney will:
- Promote State And Local Partnerships With Federal Immigration Officials. More state and local authorities should work with the federal government to enforce immigration laws.
- Improve Interior Enforcement. Governor Romney will provide additional resources to enforce existing immigration laws throughout the nation.
And I know a lot of conservatives who disagree with me on that. On immigration, for instance, I think everybody who's not a legal resident of this country should have a card, an identification card. Some people don't like that idea.
"I am proud to have the endorsement of one of the finest members of the House of Representatives. Congressman Smith has served his community, state and nation with honor and steadfast leadership. For decades, he has been a powerful voice in Congress on judiciary issues, crime and immigration. I am grateful to have his counsel in this campaign," said Governor Romney.
Governor Romney: "Well, if there are things I can do directly, such as sending our ICE agents in, terrific. What I did in Massachusetts is that I empowered the State Police to enforce federal immigration law."
Governor Romney: "There's probably some of that. I was at the border in San Diego and I talked to the border patrol agents and they said, look, they catch less than half that try and make it across at San Diego, where we have double fences. And they said if you want to stop illegal immigration, you've got to stop the magnets here. And those are sanctuary cities that say they're not going to enforce the law, they're zones of protections and there's employers..."
Governor Romney: "...that are here illegally. And by the way, it's important to point out, we value legal immigration, and I'm really concerned about legal immigrants feeling somehow this is a topic about them. I don't want them to feel uncomfortable."
Governor Romney: "Well, a couple of things. We talked about immigration the other night and there's a big difference between us there. I think Mayor Giuliani and Senator McCain are wrong in saying that all those that have come here illegally, unless they committed a crime, should be able to stay. I think that's a mistake.
"I vetoed a bill that would have given tuition breaks to illegal aliens. I insisted that we not give driver's licenses to illegal aliens, and I authorized our state police to enforce federal immigration laws." – Gov. Mitt Romney (O. Kay Henderson, "Romney Raps Clinton, Thompson Over Immigration Policy," Radio Iowa Website, www.radioiowa.com/, Posted 10/31/07)
As Governor, Mitt Romney Took Action To Stop Illegal Immigration. "Romney maintains that as governor of Massachusetts, he had an 'aggressive' and 'clear' stance against illegal immigration. 'I vetoed a bill that would have given tuition breaks to illegal aliens.

"Governor Mitt Romney and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Assistant Secretary Julie L.

(Sasha Issenberg, "Clinton backs N.Y. Driver's License Plan For Illegal Immigrants," The Boston Globe, 11/1/07)
Sen. Hillary Clinton Supports Sanctuary City Policies; Blames The Federal Government For Them. MSNBC's TIM RUSSERT: "Senator Clinton, would you allow the sanctuary cities to exist?" SEN. CLINTON: "Well, in addition to the general points that have been made, that I agree with, why do they have sanctuary cities? In large measure because if local law enforcement begins to act like immigration enforcement officers, what that means is that you will have people not reporting crimes. You will have people hiding from the police. And I think that is a real direct threat to the personal safety and security of all the citizens. So this is a result of the failure of the federal government, and that's where it needs to be fixed." (MSNBC Democratic Presidential Debate, Dartmouth, NH, 9/26/07)
Sen. Hillary Clinton Believes Cities Have No Choice But To Ignore Federal Immigration Laws. RUSSERT: "But you would allow the sanctuary cities to disobey the federal law." SEN. CLINTON: "Well, I don't think there is any choice. The ICE groups go in and raid individuals, but if you're a local police chief and you're trying to solve a crime that you know people from the immigrant community have information about, they may not talk to you if they think you're also going to be enforcing the immigration laws." (MSNBC Democratic Presidential Debate, Dartmouth, NH, 9/26/07)
- Mayor Giuliani: Nobody But The Federal Government Should Take Responsibility For Illegal Immigration. "Responsibility for stopping illegal immigration belongs to the federal government and not to cities, states or businesses, Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday. Giuliani told small-business owners he would not punish them for unwittingly hiring illegal immigrants. Federal officials are 'trying to put the responsibility for this on employers, on city government, on state government,' the former New York mayor said during a conference call arranged by the National Federation of Independent Businesses. 'The simple fact is, nobody but the federal government can stop people from coming into this country illegally, and the federal government does a very bad job of that,' Giuliani said."

The Plank's Isaac Chotiner: "Romney definitely got the best of Giuliani on their early immigration skirmish (which actually got rather heated). Rudy's line about Romney's mansion was cheap and silly. And Romney is more appealing when going negative than any of the other candidates." (The New Republic's "The Plank," http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/, Accessed, 11/28/07)
Captain's Quarters' Ed Morrissey: Romney and Huckabee had a good spar over giving better benefits to illegals for school than to citizens. Romney is absolutely 100% right on this issue. I hope Iowans realize that Huckabee may very well be worse than Bush on illegal immigration." (Heading Right, http://www.headingright.com, Accessed 11/28/07)
"Most annoying to some conservatives are Mr. Huckabee's positions on immigration. For many Republicans, immigration is the deal-breaker in judging which candidate is worthy of support. 'Rudy Giuliani spent years defending the right of New York City to remain a sanctuary for illegal aliens. Yet Giuliani was a veritable Lou Dobbs Jr. on illegal immigration in comparison to Mike Huckabee,' said Jim Boulet Jr., executive director of English First, a Springfield, Va., lobbying group." (Ralph Z. Hallow, "Huckabee Stirs Up Third Party Fear," Washington Times, 10/29/07)
Giuliani Reaffirmed CUNY's Policy Of Giving In-State Tuition To Illegal Immigrants When He Renewed New York's Sanctuary Policy. "CUNY's policy of charging illegal immigrants the lower rate reflected the city's historic embrace of immigrants and conformed to a policy laid out by Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1989 and reaffirmed by Mayors David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani. In reviewing the policy, Mr. Schaffer came across a brief section of a 1996 immigration law that said illegal immigrants should not be eligible for educational benefits not available to American citizens from other states, CUNY officials said. When the law was passed, CUNY lawyers reviewed it and decided that the university should not make changes until regulations were issued to carry out the law. Mr. Schaffer said he concluded, however, that at this point the university had no choice but to change its tuition policy." (Karen W. Arenson, "CUNY Raises Tuition Rates For Foreigners Here Illegally," The New York Times, 11/3/01)
The Washington Post Recently Noted That Huckabee Has Been Misleading On The Issue. "On Fox News Wednesday, he was asked about a bill he supported as governor that would have granted tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants. He suggested that he had only wanted to give such children access to scholarships. 'What I supported was the idea that if a student had been in our Arkansas high schools and had done academically well to be able to compete for an academic challenged scholarship which was meritorious then that student should be able to have the same opportunity as anyone else,' Huckabee said. In fact, the initial bill he supported did have a scholarship provision. But that provision was later stripped out, and was not included in the legislation that Huckabee continued to push. The bill read: 'Any tuition rate that is granted to residents of Arkansas shall be granted on the same terms to all persons, regardless of immigration status, who have attended a secondary educational institution in Arkansas for at least three (3) years and who have either graduated from an Arkansas high school or received a general education diploma in the state.'" (Michael D. Shear, "Rising in Iowa Polls, Huckabee Now In Crosshairs," The Washington Post, http://blog.washingtonpost.com/, Posted 11/15/07)
"Now that Mr. Huckabee has reached first place in Iowa polls, those days are over. His 10 1/2 years as Arkansas governor and his conservative credentials are now relentlessly scrutinized, and Mr. Huckabee is under fire for substantial increases in taxes and spending by the Club for Growth and the CATO Institute. Numbers USA, a research and advocacy organization which opposes illegal immigration and monitors politicians' records on the issue, is sharply critical of his record as governor."
"Mr. Huckabee has come under withering fire from critics of illegal immigration. Asked last month about complaints that he is 'soft' on illegals, the former Arkansas governor said he opposed sanctuary cities and opposes amnesty, although he contradicted himself somewhat by adding that he believes illegal aliens can be put on a path to citizenship.

It requires changing human behavior – but it needs to be done for everyone's good. I have the will.

As Mayor, Giuliani Boasted That New York City Was "Quite Tolerant Of Undocumented Immigration." GIULIANI: " The city of New York, quite frankly, is quite tolerant of undocumented immigration and this shouldn't surprise you because I've been the Mayor for a long time and outspoken on this issue, even nationally, I happen to agree with that. I think New York City should not deal with undocumented immigrants in a harsh way, I think they make a big contribution to the life of the city and were much better off being sensible and practical about it. And the reality is that restaurants are going to have a certain number of people who are undocumented, you know people that come here to make a living trying to help them selves and their families." (WABC Radio's "Live From City Hall...With Rudy Giuliani," 9/7/01, www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhS-Ic9JohM)
"It is an honor to have the support of Sheriff Babeu," said Mitt Romney. "His efforts working to protect our border are critical to lowering crime, reducing illegal immigration, and stopping both drug and human trafficking. Sheriff Babeu has been a leader in the call for the federal government to secure the border. As President, I will work with leaders like Sheriff Babeu to protect our Southern border, provide the required assistance from the federal government, and put an end to the magnets that cause illegal immigration."
Announcing his support, Sheriff Babeu said, "Securing our border is an important part of our national security – Mitt Romney understands this. He also understands that magnets like in-state tuition for illegal immigrants don't stop illegal immigration, they only make it worse. Of all the candidates, Mitt Romney has shown that he is the most committed to securing the border and I look forward to working with him to do this."
Sheriff Paul Babeu is the Sheriff of Pinal County in Arizona. Babeu heads a department of 700 and has worked to cut the budget, reorganize leadership, and reduce the response time from his department. Babeu has been a national leader on the need to secure our border and stop illegal immigration and drug and human trafficking. This year, Sheriff Babeu was named Sheriff of the Year by the National Sheriffs' Association. Sheriff Babeu serves as President of the Arizona Sheriffs' Association and recently retired from the Army National Guard. As an Army Major, Babeu commanded nearly 700 soldiers in the Yuma Sector and helped reduced illegal entries by 96%.
And I know a lot of conservatives who disagree with me on that. On immigration, for instance, I think everybody who's not a legal resident of this country should have a card, an identification card. Some people don't like that idea.
McCain-Kennedy isn't the answer. As governor, I took a very different approach. I authorized our state police to enforce immigration laws. I vetoed a tuition break for illegals and said no to driver's licenses. McCain-Kennedy gives benefits to illegals that would cost taxpayers millions. And more importantly, amnesty didn't work 20 years ago, and it won't work today.
Sixth, as we finally and belatedly secure the border and solve the problem of illegal immigration, we must reaffirm our appreciation of legal immigration. We are a nation of immigrants and refugees, and they have contributed a great deal to our culture of hard work, entrepreneurship, faith in God, love of family, and respect for human life.
Nashua Telegraph Columnist Jennifer Horn: "Without doubt former MA Gov Mitt Romney was the winner by every scale. He was the most presidential of all, and not just in the way he combed his hair.

He was likeable, respectful of the other candidates and set the tone for the entire debate." (Jennifer Horn, "First GOP Debate," Jennifer Horn Online, 5/4/07)
The Democrats have a plan for illegal immigration as well. It's amnesty. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and their colleagues insist that every illegal immigrant become a legal permanent resident of this country. Some people think that their position has less to do with compassion than with calculation - they hope these illegal immigrants will vote them in power forever.
But this is not about power or politics. It is about sovereignty and security. And it is about fairness. Millions of applicants are waiting to come here legally, to be joined with family members, to bring education and skill that will strengthen our nation, not burden it. Legal immigration is a boon to our nation. We are made a greater nation when immigrants come here legally, seeking opportunity.
"This incident underscores the pressing need to strengthen the enforcement of our current immigration laws. I strongly disagree with the other candidates in this race who are dismissive of increased enforcement efforts and continue to defend sanctuary city policies that weaken our border security efforts and create zones of protection for illegal immigration. Those policies are wrong and the defense of such policies highlights how a 3 million illegal immigrant problem became a 12 million illegal immigrant problem."
- SOLUTION #6: Reforming Our Immigration System. Governor Romney believes we must enforce our laws, secure our border, put in place an enforceable employment verification system, and provide no special pathway to citizenship for those here illegally. We must also encourage legal immigration and streamline the system to recruit and retain high-skilled workers and welcome the best and the brightest from around the world to our universities.
"Tonight, Governor Romney spoke to the important issues confronting America today. Governor Romney believes that we all benefit from a Washington that stands for a stronger economy, stronger defense and stronger families. In 2008, our Party will have an important choice and Governor Romney made that choice clear tonight on immigration, health care, education and foreign policy. With Governor Romney's experience, vision and values, we can beat the Democrats and build a stronger America."
- SOLUTION #11: Reforming Our Immigration System. We must encourage legal immigration and streamline the system to recruit and retain high-skilled workers and welcome the best and the brightest from around the world to our universities.
Governor Romney Will Reform America's Immigration System. Governor Romney believes we must reform our immigration laws so that we can end illegal immigration. America will always welcome legal immigration, but as a nation we also insist on the rule of law. Governor Romney has outlined the solutions necessary to meet this challenge by:
- SOLUTION #5: Improving Interior Enforcement. Governor Romney will provide additional resources to enforce existing immigration laws throughout the nation. We cannot be serious about our immigration laws until we provide the resources needed to enforce them. Governor Romney supports the Administration's steps to strengthen the enforcement of our current immigration laws.
"Governor Romney is the candidate who shares my passion for pro-family issues, and will also be our best advocate for fiscal and defense conservatives," said Representative Betty De Boef. "He is a leader in the fight to secure our border, and we can trust him to turn off the magnets that encourage illegal immigration. I look forward to working hard for his team, making sure that other pro-family voters know Governor Romney is the candidate to support on caucus night."

That Washington has made promises and not delivered on those promises and they are tired of waiting for change. And we will bring change. You heard about illegal immigration, they promised change there, they haven't delivered. You heard about reducing the tax burden on the middle class and burdens on the middle class, they haven't delivered on that. We've talked about improving our schools, that hasn't been delivered. Getting health care for all of our citizens, that hasn't been delivered. And one, that as you know, Michigan cares about most deeply, and that is rebuilding and strengthening our economy, helping elevate wages, growing our middle class, making sure that we lead the world in technology and innovation and design and patents. It's been promised time and again, and I will actually get the job done because I have done it before." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks, 1/9/08)

Boston, MA - Romney for President today launched its newest television ad, "Tested, Proven." The ad highlights Governor Romney's strong conservative leadership making the toughest decisions in one of our country's most liberal states. As Governor, he acted to cut spending, fought against tax increases, enforced immigration laws, championed traditional marriage and defended the sanctity of human life.
"He enforced immigration laws, stood up for traditional marriage and the sanctity of human life."
Governor Mitt Romney: "Well, I was very pleased. A couple of things happened. One was Senator McCain and I were able to distinguish ourselves on the issue of immigration in a way that I think will be lasting in people's minds. The other was with regards to Mayor Giuliani. I speak about three-legs to the Republican stool being necessary to win a general election, which is a conservative base in terms of military, economic and family and family values. And he talks about a two-legged stool. And so I think those distinctions are going to be memorable and probably set a bit of the course for the future of this campaign."
Cameron: "You mention the distinctions between yourself and Senator McCain on immigration. Obviously, he's pushing the immigration reform bill in Congress, one of the sponsors of it, and you're opposed to that. We were led to believe that yesterday was going to be a bit of a confrontation between the two of you and it might have been a bit feisty and yet it didn't happen. It seemed to be much more decorous. Why?"
Cameron: "He might quibble with the idea that there's an agreement. Yesterday, he made it very clear that he thinks those who are criticizing the proposals, it's time to put up or shut up and come up with a plan. When do we see Mitt Romney's immigration treatise?"

Boston, MA - Today, Romney for President launched its newest radio ad, "Exceptional." The ad highlights Governor Romney's plan to cut back federal funds from cities that adopt sanctuary policies and ignore federal immigration laws. Governor Romney has a record of enforcing our immigration laws. He deputized the State Police to enforce federal immigration law, opposed drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants, and insisted that our children learn in English.
"Sanctuary cities become magnets that encourage illegal immigration and undermine secure borders.
"As Governor, Mitt Romney didn't wait on Washington. He acted to make our immigration laws work.
"Mitt Romney is the exceptional Governor who took a stand so State Police could enforce federal immigration laws.

Some suggested that the only reason that the three illegal aliens were in the United States, despite their extensive arrest histories, was because the NYPD officers who arrested these aliens previously were barred by a so-called 'sanctuary' policy from contacting the INS. That policy, critics claimed, prevented NYPD officers from contacting the INS when they arrested an illegal alien. We will examine New York City's policy on the NYPD's disclosure of immigration information to the INS. New York's Executive Order, or E.O. 124, barred line officers from communicating directly with the INS about criminal aliens. That executive order was issued by Mayor Ed Koch in 1989 and reissued by Mayors Dinkins and Giuliani."

Giuliani Reaffirmed CUNY's Policy Of Giving In-State Tuition To Illegal Immigrants When He Renewed New York's Sanctuary Policy. "CUNY's policy of charging illegal immigrants the lower rate reflected the city's historic embrace of immigrants and conformed to a policy laid out by Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1989 and reaffirmed by Mayors David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani. In reviewing the policy, Mr. Schaffer came across a brief section of a 1996 immigration law that said illegal immigrants should not be eligible for educational benefits not available to American citizens from other states, CUNY officials said. When the law was passed, CUNY lawyers reviewed it and decided that the university should not make changes until regulations were issued to carry out the law. Mr. Schaffer said he concluded, however, that at this point the university had no choice but to change its tuition policy." (Karen W. Arenson, "CUNY Raises Tuition Rates For Foreigners Here Illegally," The New York Times, 11/3/01)
The Washington Post Recently Noted That Huckabee Has Been Misleading On The Issue. "On Fox News Wednesday, he was asked about a bill he supported as governor that would have granted tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants. He suggested that he had only wanted to give such children access to scholarships. 'What I supported was the idea that if a student had been in our Arkansas high schools and had done academically well to be able to compete for an academic challenged scholarship which was meritorious then that student should be able to have the same opportunity as anyone else,' Huckabee said. In fact, the initial bill he supported did have a scholarship provision. But that provision was later stripped out, and was not included in the legislation that Huckabee continued to push. The bill read: 'Any tuition rate that is granted to residents of Arkansas shall be granted on the same terms to all persons, regardless of immigration status, who have attended a secondary educational institution in Arkansas for at least three (3) years and who have either graduated from an Arkansas high school or received a general education diploma in the state.'"

Governor Romney Will Enforce Our Laws And Reform Our Immigration System. America's immigration system is broken, but for too long all our leaders in Washington have done is talk about ending illegal immigration. Governor Romney believes we must enforce and reform our immigration laws so that we can end illegal immigration. To end illegal immigraiton, Governor Romney will:
- Promote State And Local Partnerships With Federal Immigration Officials. More state and local authorities should work with the federal government to enforce immigration laws.
- Improve Interior Enforcement. Governor Romney will provide additional resources to enforce existing immigration laws throughout the nation.
- Governor Romney: "Folks who come from Michigan recognize, like people across this country, that Washington has failed them time and again. That Washington has made promises and not delivered on those promises and they are tired of waiting for change. And we will bring change. You heard about illegal immigration, they promised change there, they haven't delivered. You heard about reducing the tax burden on the middle class and burdens on the middle class, they haven't delivered on that. We've talked about improving our schools, that hasn't been delivered. Getting health care for all of our citizens, that hasn't been delivered. And one, that as you know, Michigan cares about most deeply, and that is rebuilding and strengthening our economy, helping elevate wages, growing our middle class, making sure that we lead the world in technology and innovation and design and patents. It's been promised time and again, and I will actually get the job done because I have done it before." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks, 1/9/08)

We've asked them to fix illegal immigration. They haven't.
And I know a lot of conservatives who disagree with me on that. On immigration, for instance, I think everybody who's not a legal resident of this country should have a card, an identification card. Some people don't like that idea.
Sixth, as we finally and belatedly secure the border and solve the problem of illegal immigration, we must reaffirm our appreciation of legal immigration. We are a nation of immigrants and refugees, and they have contributed a great deal to our culture of hard work, entrepreneurship, faith in God, love of family, and respect for human life.
Nashua Telegraph Columnist Jennifer Horn: "Without doubt former MA Gov Mitt Romney was the winner by every scale. He was the most presidential of all, and not just in the way he combed his hair. He was clear, decisive, firm and unwavering. He was strong on defense, abortion, immigration, healthcare and the economy. He was likeable, respectful of the other candidates and set the tone for the entire debate." (Jennifer Horn, "First GOP Debate," Jennifer Horn Online, 5/4/07)
The Democrats have a plan for illegal immigration as well. It's amnesty. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and their colleagues insist that every illegal immigrant become a legal permanent resident of this country. Some people think that their position has less to do with compassion than with calculation - they hope these illegal immigrants will vote them in power forever.
But this is not about power or politics. It is about sovereignty and security. And it is about fairness. Millions of applicants are waiting to come here legally, to be joined with family members, to bring education and skill that will strengthen our nation, not burden it. Legal immigration is a boon to our nation. We are made a greater nation when immigrants come here legally, seeking opportunity.
"Our guiding principle has always been to select the most conservative viable candidate. In our judgment, that candidate is Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. Unlike some other candidates in the race, Romney is a full-spectrum conservative: a supporter of free-market economics and limited government, moral causes such as the right to life and the preservation of marriage, and a foreign policy based on the national interest. While he has not talked much about the importance of resisting ethnic balkanization – none of the major candidates has – he supports enforcing the immigration laws and opposes amnesty. Those are important steps in the right direction."
Governor Romney: "I think people recognize that Washington is fundamentally broken. For years, it has been promising help for Michigan, it hasn't delivered. It said it would solve Social Security, didn't get the job done. It would stop illegal immigration, hasn't gotten that job done. Said it would get us off foreign oil, didn't get that job done. And so people recognize that just sending back the same old folks, both parties, just to take different chairs in Washington is not going to get America on track again. We're going to have to have new faces that bring a new vision to Washington and deal with the problems that we have. And I'm not a life-long politician. I'm used to the private sector where if all you can do is talk, you get fired. You got to get the job done, and I'm going to Washington to get the job done."

McCain-Kennedy isn't the answer. As governor, I took a very different approach. I authorized our state police to enforce immigration laws. I vetoed a tuition break for illegals and said no to driver's licenses. McCain-Kennedy gives benefits to illegals that would cost taxpayers millions. And more importantly, amnesty didn't work 20 years ago, and it won't work today.

Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on Senator John McCain's (R-AZ) immigration remarks in Miami, Florida:
"The immigration approach proposed by Senators McCain and Kennedy falls short of a workable solution to an important problem. I respect Senator McCain, but my opposition to his bill is a matter of principled disagreement about policies and priorities related to enforcement of our immigration laws.
"In reforming our immigration system, we must meet three priorities. First, we can and must secure our borders. Second, our country must have an enforceable employment verification system. Third, in reforming our immigration system, we must do so in a way that rewards immigrants who obey the laws and guards against providing special incentives for those who show no regard for them."

Governor Mitt Romney: "Well, I was very pleased. A couple of things happened. One was Senator McCain and I were able to distinguish ourselves on the issue of immigration in a way that I think will be lasting in people's minds. The other was with regards to Mayor Giuliani. I speak about three-legs to the Republican stool being necessary to win a general election, which is a conservative base in terms of military, economic and family and family values. And he talks about a two-legged stool. And so I think those distinctions are going to be memorable and probably set a bit of the course for the future of this campaign."
Cameron: "You mention the distinctions between yourself and Senator McCain on immigration. Obviously, he's pushing the immigration reform bill in Congress, one of the sponsors of it, and you're opposed to that. We were led to believe that yesterday was going to be a bit of a confrontation between the two of you and it might have been a bit feisty and yet it didn't happen. It seemed to be much more decorous. Why?"
Cameron: "He might quibble with the idea that there's an agreement. Yesterday, he made it very clear that he thinks those who are criticizing the proposals, it's time to put up or shut up and come up with a plan. When do we see Mitt Romney's immigration treatise?"

Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on the Administration's new measures to enforce our nation's immigration laws:
"Today's announcement of stepped-up measures to enforce existing immigration law is a welcome development. We must get serious if we are to secure our nation's borders.
"For far too long, lax enforcement and the adoption of policies that have created sanctuary cities for those entering the country illegally have put a strain on our border enforcement efforts and worsened our illegal immigration problem. We must take action to prevent sanctuary city policies that invite more illegal immigration and offer zones of protection for lawbreakers.
"As a governor who worked with the federal government to deputize state law enforcement officials to enforce immigration laws, I understand the importance of joint federal-state efforts to uphold the law and take action against illegal immigration.
"I applaud this strong and urgent action to strengthen our border security and enforce existing immigration laws."
Fox News' John Gibson: "Mitt Romney is with me now. In this fight with Rudy Giuliani over who is tougher on illegal immigration and sanctuary cities, what is your record on opposing sanctuary cities in the state that you governed?"
Governor Mitt Romney: "Well, I wasn't a mayor, I was a governor, and so as a governor, I did everything in my power to make sure we weren't attracting people to come in to our state illegally. I authorized our state police to enforce federal laws against immigration. I also vetoed a law that the legislature passed that would have given tuition breaks to illegal aliens. I also said we're going to have English immersion in our schools and statement after statement that I made said we're going to do nothing to make our state an attractive place for illegal aliens.
Governor Romney: "Exactly what I'm suggesting mayors throughout the country do, and that is conform with the federal law. We did that in our state. I authorized our state police to implement and to carry out federal immigration policy. We're going to have to enforce the law. Now, that doesn't mean we're going to round up in the case of the Mayor 400,000 people and deport them all at once, but it also doesn't mean you go out on the public airwaves and say, 'If you're illegal, we want you to come here.' That's a very bad message to be sending to people around the world who want to come to America illegally. This is important because we want legal immigration to continue and to be welcomed to this country - but illegal immigration that's got to end."
Boston, MA - Today, Romney for President launched its newest radio ad, "Exceptional."

- In February 2003, The U.S. House Judiciary Committee Held A Hearing Entitled "New York City's 'Sanctuary' Policy And The Effect Of Such Policies On Public Safety, Law Enforcement, And Immigration." Rep. John N. Hostettler (R-IN): "On December 19, 2002, a 42-year-old mother of two was abducted and forced by her assailants into a hideout near some railroad tracks in Queens, New York. ... The NYPD arrested five aliens in connection with that assault. ... Some suggested that the only reason that the three illegal aliens were in the United States, despite their extensive arrest histories, was because the NYPD officers who arrested these aliens previously were barred by a so-called 'sanctuary' policy from contacting the INS. That policy, critics claimed, prevented NYPD officers from contacting the INS when they arrested an illegal alien. We will examine New York City's policy on the NYPD's disclosure of immigration information to the INS. New York's Executive Order, or E.O. 124, barred line officers from communicating directly with the INS about criminal aliens. That executive order was issued by Mayor Ed Koch in 1989 and reissued by Mayors Dinkins and Giuliani."

Governor Romney: "Well, if there are things I can do directly, such as sending our ICE agents in, terrific. What I did in Massachusetts is that I empowered the State Police to enforce federal immigration law."
Governor Romney: "There's probably some of that. I was at the border in San Diego and I talked to the border patrol agents and they said, look, they catch less than half that try and make it across at San Diego, where we have double fences. And they said if you want to stop illegal immigration, you've got to stop the magnets here. And those are sanctuary cities that say they're not going to enforce the law, they're zones of protections and there's employers..."
Governor Romney: "...that are here illegally. And by the way, it's important to point out, we value legal immigration, and I'm really concerned about legal immigrants feeling somehow this is a topic about them. I don't want them to feel uncomfortable."
Governor Romney: "Well, a couple of things. We talked about immigration the other night and there's a big difference between us there. I think Mayor Giuliani and Senator McCain are wrong in saying that all those that have come here illegally, unless they committed a crime, should be able to stay. I think that's a mistake.
"This incident underscores the pressing need to strengthen the enforcement of our current immigration laws. I strongly disagree with the other candidates in this race who are dismissive of increased enforcement efforts and continue to defend sanctuary city policies that weaken our border security efforts and create zones of protection for illegal immigration. Those policies are wrong and the defense of such policies highlights how a 3 million illegal immigrant problem became a 12 million illegal immigrant problem."
"I believe that President Felipe Calderon will be an invaluable partner on bilateral and regional issues like trade, immigration and combating cross-border drug trafficking that threatens both our nations' futures. He has already demonstrated courageous leadership in taking on the violent cartels and deserves our respect and cooperation in this effort. There is also good reason to feel optimistic that his determination to modernize Mexico's economy will strengthen our robust trade ties which help generate jobs on both sides of the border.
Boston, MA – Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, "Change Begins With Us." The ad features Governor Romney talking directly about his belief that change in Washington begins with his fellow Republicans putting their house in order. The Republican Party needs to return to its core conservative principles on issues like fiscal responsibility, ending illegal immigration and upholding ethical standards. By returning to these principles and bringing conservative change to Washington, Republicans and Governor Romney can build a stronger America.

We can't be like Democrats – a party of big spending. We can't pretend our borders are secure from illegal immigration. We can't have ethical standards that are a punch-line for Jay Leno.
Conservative Activist Richard Viguerie: "'At last, a top-tier presidential candidate is paying attention to the discouraged, disheartened and disillusioned base of the Republican Party,' Viguerie said, pointing to a Romney TV ad criticizing the party's 'excessive spending, immigration amnesty and ethical slackness.' Viguerie, a powerful voice in the party's conservative base, said Romney 'has taken a small but significant step toward reclaiming the GOP for the grassroots conservatives who are its backbone.'"

I am pleased to have his support," said Governor Romney. "We agree that illegal immigration is a critical issue for our country. We need to ensure our existing immigration laws are enforced and end "sanctuary city" policies that encourage illegal immigration. Our focus should be on securing the border, implementing a tamperproof employment verification system and ensuring there is no special pathway to citizenship for those that come here illegally."
"I have had an opportunity to look at the records of other candidates, and it is clear that Governor Romney is the candidate with the most impressive record of accomplishment in the public and private sectors and the strongest record of enforcing our immigration laws," said Sheriff Hunter. "As Governor of Massachusetts, he worked with the federal government to allow Massachusetts state troopers to enforce federal immigration laws, vetoed in-state tuition at public colleges and universities for illegal immigrants, promoted English immersion in the education system and opposed driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. I am proud to endorse Governor Romney for President of the United States and know his conservative leadership will steer our country in the right direction."

Governor Romney's Plan To Reform Our Immigration System:
Today, In New Hampshire, Governor Mitt Romney Discussed His Plan To Reform America's Immigration System. America's immigration system is broken. Governor Romney believes we must reform our immigration laws so that we can end illegal immigration. America will always welcome legal immigration, but as a nation we also insist on the rule of law. To reform our immigration system and enhance America's national security, Governor Romney will:
- End The Magnet Of "Sanctuary Cities." Governor Romney will cut back federal funding to cities that are "sanctuaries" for illegal immigrants and refuse to comply with federal law or aid federal law enforcement. Sanctuary cities tell those who are here illegally that the laws of this country do not matter and become magnets for illegal immigration.
- Promote State And Local Partnerships With Federal Immigration Officials. Governor Romney believes more state and local authorities should work with the federal government to enforce immigration laws. This builds off of his experience in Massachusetts where he deputized the State Police to work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and enforce federal immigration laws.
- Improve Interior Enforcement. Governor Romney will provide additional resources to enforce existing immigration laws throughout the nation. We cannot be serious about our immigration laws until we provide the resources needed to enforce them. Governor Romney supports the Administration's steps to strengthen the enforcement of our current immigration laws.
- Encourage Legal Immigration. Governor Romney will streamline the visa system to recruit and retain skilled workers in high demand by U.S. companies. He will also welcome the best and the brightest from around the world to our universities. We must stop illegal immigration so we can encourage legal immigration.
- Governor Romney: "The scope of our nation's illegal immigration problem requires us to pursue and implement new solutions wherever possible. State troopers are highly trained professionals who are prepared to assist the federal government in apprehending immigration violators without disrupting their normal law enforcement routines." (Jonathan Saltzman, "Romney OK's Pact So Troopers Can Arrest Illegal Immigrants," The Boston Globe, 12/14/06)
In a joint statement, the sheriffs said, "In Massachusetts, Governor Romney was a staunch advocate for state and local law enforcement and has a strong record on law enforcement issues ranging from helping enable state troopers to enforce immigration laws to imposing tougher penalties on dangerous sex offenders. As a candidate, Governor Romney is the only individual in the race who continues to propose substantive solutions to the challenges we face as a nation, both domestically and abroad. We are proud to support Governor Romney because he has the experience, values and vision needed to lead America in the right direction."
- Daily News: Under Mayor Giuliani, "Illegal" Didn't Have Any Meaning. "But at the same time, federal immigration laws must be enforced strictly. For no nation can allow its borders to be violated with impunity. And state and local governments must help. In New York, that means making the adjective 'illegal' mean something when it appears before the word 'immigrant.' ... In other words, legal or illegal, the law makes no distinction. Then what's the law for?" (Editorial, "Not All Immigrants Are Equal," [New York] Daily News, 3/23/97)
Scarborough: "Hey, we just had Bill Bennett on earlier, and he was talking about how illegal immigration remains one of the key issues for people that call into his show, and he believes it's going to be a huge issue this year. If that's the case, how do you separate yourself from the rest of the pack on the Republican side on this issue?"
"States that provide driver's licenses to illegal immigrants act as a magnet for more illegal immigration and frustrate our country's efforts to control the borders. Unlike Senator Clinton, I oppose driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. As president, I will adopt policies that discourage states from turning into sanctuaries."

(Stephen Dinan, "Giuliani Eyes Citizenship Path For Illegals," The Washington Times, 8/15/07)
Governor Romney: "Well, there's no question but that we do have a pretty big gap between us on the issue of illegal immigration. Mayor Giuliani supported a sanctuary city, his own in New York. I said I'd cut back funding to any city that calls itself a sanctuary city for illegal aliens. And likewise, giving a tuition break to the children of illegals that are here illegally when citizens are having to pay a higher rate, that makes no sense to me at all and that's something Mike Huckabee supported when he was governor of Arkansas. I vetoed a measure like that in my state and that veto was upheld. We have some differences between us, probably the biggest difference is that I spent my life outside of politics, and they've spent their lives inside politics."
Governor Romney: "Her greatest weaknesses? Her current positions. Frankly, her weakness on illegal immigration, her weakness on taxation, raising taxes everyone knows is the wrong way to go, her weakness in terms of not having any experience in the private sector. She's never had a job in a small business enterprise, knowing why jobs come and go. I can't wait to talk about that with her, and then of course her health care plan. Socialized medicine will never be acceptable in this country. You know, I almost can't think of all the list of things. She says she has a million good ideas for America, we just can't afford them. We'll have a million good reasons why we should not elect Hillary Clinton."

So he created an environment which is now known as a sanctuary city. That kind of sanctuary policy is in fact what has led to the extraordinary explosion in illegal aliens coming into this country. And I have exactly the opposite view, I think we should cut back on federal funds to cities that won't enforce the federal immigration laws. I like legal immigration, but illegal immigration has got to end and this sanctuary city policy and these amnesty policies. He is absolutely wrong and I will fight those at every turn."

"Governor Mitt Romney is the best candidate to represent Arizona's interest in Washington. He understands the issues that Arizonans care deeply about, like strengthening our immigration policy and protecting our borders. Mitt Romney has the leadership experience, conservative values and vision to lead this country forward. We are committed to his campaign because he is committed to the people of Arizona. We look forward to working with him toward victory in February."
The American Spectator's Philip Klein: "... I thought Romney got the better of that [immigration] exchange. It's one thing to use Romney's illegal immigrant lawn care workers in a joke, but it's another thing to try and base a serious criticism on that."

National Review's Ramesh Ponnuru: "So Romney did pretty well in the debate, and won the immigration exchange." (Ramesh Ponnuru, "A Good Day for Giuliani," National Review's The Corner, http://corner.nationalreview.com, Posted 11/28/07)
The Plank's Isaac Chotiner: "Romney definitely got the best of Giuliani on their early immigration skirmish (which actually got rather heated). Rudy's line about Romney's mansion was cheap and silly. And Romney is more appealing when going negative than any of the other candidates." (The New Republic's "The Plank," http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/, Accessed, 11/28/07)
Captain's Quarters' Ed Morrissey: Romney and Huckabee had a good spar over giving better benefits to illegals for school than to citizens. Romney is absolutely 100% right on this issue. I hope Iowans realize that Huckabee may very well be worse than Bush on illegal immigration." (Heading Right, http://www.headingright.com, Accessed 11/28/07)
"Most annoying to some conservatives are Mr. Huckabee's positions on immigration. For many Republicans, immigration is the deal-breaker in judging which candidate is worthy of support. 'Rudy Giuliani spent years defending the right of New York City to remain a sanctuary for illegal aliens. Yet Giuliani was a veritable Lou Dobbs Jr. on illegal immigration in comparison to Mike Huckabee,' said Jim Boulet Jr., executive director of English First, a Springfield, Va., lobbying group." (Ralph Z. Hallow, "Huckabee Stirs Up Third Party Fear," Washington Times, 10/29/07)
Giuliani Reaffirmed CUNY's Policy Of Giving In-State Tuition To Illegal Immigrants When He Renewed New York's Sanctuary Policy. "CUNY's policy of charging illegal immigrants the lower rate reflected the city's historic embrace of immigrants and conformed to a policy laid out by Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1989 and reaffirmed by Mayors David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani. In reviewing the policy, Mr. Schaffer came across a brief section of a 1996 immigration law that said illegal immigrants should not be eligible for educational benefits not available to American citizens from other states, CUNY officials said. When the law was passed, CUNY lawyers reviewed it and decided that the university should not make changes until regulations were issued to carry out the law. Mr. Schaffer said he concluded, however, that at this point the university had no choice but to change its tuition policy." (Karen W. Arenson, "CUNY Raises Tuition Rates For Foreigners Here Illegally," The New York Times, 11/3/01)
The Washington Post Recently Noted That Huckabee Has Been Misleading On The Issue. "On Fox News Wednesday, he was asked about a bill he supported as governor that would have granted tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants. He suggested that he had only wanted to give such children access to scholarships. 'What I supported was the idea that if a student had been in our Arkansas high schools and had done academically well to be able to compete for an academic challenged scholarship which was meritorious then that student should be able to have the same opportunity as anyone else,' Huckabee said. In fact, the initial bill he supported did have a scholarship provision. But that provision was later stripped out, and was not included in the legislation that Huckabee continued to push. The bill read: 'Any tuition rate that is granted to residents of Arkansas shall be granted on the same terms to all persons, regardless of immigration status, who have attended a secondary educational institution in Arkansas for at least three (3) years and who have either graduated from an Arkansas high school or received a general education diploma in the state.'" (Michael D. Shear, "Rising in Iowa Polls, Huckabee Now In Crosshairs," The Washington Post, http://blog.washingtonpost.com/, Posted 11/15/07)
The American Spectator's Philip Klein: "The defining moment of the debate was the Romney vs. Rudy exchange on immigration, and I thought Romney came off better once Giuliani went with the 'Sanctuary Mansion' line. Not only did the argument lack substance, but it came off as a cheap shot." (Philip Klein, "Closing Thoughts," The American Spectator's AmSpec Blog, Posted 11/28/07)
New York Post's Rich Lowry: "Romney is fluid and unflappable, and showed early on tonight in immigration exchanges with Giuliani and Huckabee something that he has seemed to lack in this campaign - toughness." (Rich Lowry, Op-Ed, "Battling The Past," New York Post, 11/29/07)
Fox News' Frank Luntz: "Mitt Romney came at Rudy Giuliani directly at the beginning of the debate, and watch how more favorably the reaction is from our dials... when Mitt Romney so clearly differentiated his point of view on immigration to Rudy Giuliani's, that's the incredible response he got back."

- Huckabee Has Been Called "A Treacherous Liberal On Taxes, Social Welfare Spending And Illegal Immigration." "Mr. Minton voices the concerns of many conservatives that while Mr. Huckabee governed as a social conservative in opposing abortion and same-sex 'marriage,' he was a treacherous liberal on taxes, social welfare spending and illegal immigration." (Ralph Z. Hallow, "Huckabee Stirs Up Third Party Fear," The Washington Times, 10/29/07)
In An Editorial, The [Arkansas] Leader Called Huckabee "One Of The Most Liberal Governor's In Arkansas History." "His record has been both Huckabee's strength and his Achilles' heel, as we have had occasion to observe. He is one of the most liberal governors in Arkansas history, having accounted for more tax increases than any other and having enlarged state government more than any other. He has exorbitantly inflated his record as a tax-cutter on the stump and now that will catch up with him. But we continue to believe that if he will shoot straight with the Republican constituencies, his record and his moderate views on such things as immigration and government health assistance could make him the party's best opponent to Sen. Hillary Clinton, the expected Democratic nominee. That is not the conventional wisdom, but it will be his best pitch." (Editorial, "Huck Keeps Moving Up," The [Arkansas] Leader, 10/31/07)
Ingraham: "I know Mike Huckabee is a nice man. And I know he has a wonderful style. And he's good on a lot of issues. He's great on the life issue. Great on marriage. Great on all these things. But on this [immigration] issue, which is so important to so many of us, I am tired of this double speak. The taxpayers are footing the bill for this. This is the money of the taxpayers of Arkansas. And if you offer these benefits to illegal aliens, more illegal aliens will come into your state. That is just a fact.
- SOLUTION #6: Reforming Our Immigration System. Governor Romney believes we must enforce our laws, secure our border, put in place an enforceable employment verification system, and provide no special pathway to citizenship for those here illegally. We must also encourage legal immigration and streamline the system to recruit and retain high-skilled workers and welcome the best and the brightest from around the world to our universities.
"This evening, Governor Romney gave a winning performance in the historic Univision Republican Presidential Forum, speaking frankly, openly and warmly about the issues most important to Hispanic voters and demonstrating that he is the only candidate that can bring true conservative change to Washington. On every issue raised, Governor Romney proved he is the leader that can apply conservative principles to strengthen our military, economy and families. Additionally, I am confident that Governor Romney's plan to improve our legal immigration policies and adopt sensible immigration reform will be embraced by the majority of Hispanics in our country. Tonight's debate was a tremendous opportunity for voters in the Hispanic community to learn more about Governor Romney's experience, vision and values."
"Tonight, Governor Romney spoke to the important issues confronting America today. Governor Romney believes that we all benefit from a Washington that stands for a stronger economy, stronger defense and stronger families. In 2008, our Party will have an important choice and Governor Romney made that choice clear tonight on immigration, health care, education and foreign policy. With Governor Romney's experience, vision and values, we can beat the Democrats and build a stronger America."
Boston, MA – Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, "Choice: The Record." The ad highlights the very important choice voters will have to make when it comes to confronting illegal immigration. While Governors Romney and Huckabee both believe in protecting life and traditional marriage, they have very different records on enforcing our immigration laws. In Massachusetts, Governor Romney stood up and vetoed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants and opposed driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. In Arkansas, Governor Huckabee supported in-state tuition breaks and taxpayer-funded scholarships for illegal immigrants.
"On immigration, the choice matters."
- Governor Romney Vetoed In-State Tuition For Illegal Immigrants. "Mr. Romney also cut several outside sections, including a plan that would allow illegal aliens to pay in-state tuition rates at state colleges and universities; he said the plan would encourage illegal immigration." (Shaun Sutner, "Romney Approves $22.5B Budget," Telegram &amp; Gazette, 6/26/04)
"Now that Mr. Huckabee has reached first place in Iowa polls, those days are over. His 10 1/2 years as Arkansas governor and his conservative credentials are now relentlessly scrutinized, and Mr. Huckabee is under fire for substantial increases in taxes and spending by the Club for Growth and the CATO Institute. Numbers USA, a research and advocacy organization which opposes illegal immigration and monitors politicians' records on the issue, is sharply critical of his record as governor."
"Mr. Huckabee has come under withering fire from critics of illegal immigration. Asked last month about complaints that he is 'soft' on illegals, the former Arkansas governor said he opposed sanctuary cities and opposes amnesty, although he contradicted himself somewhat by adding that he believes illegal aliens can be put on a path to citizenship.
"Our guiding principle has always been to select the most conservative viable candidate. In our judgment, that candidate is Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. Unlike some other candidates in the race, Romney is a full-spectrum conservative: a supporter of free-market economics and limited government, moral causes such as the right to life and the preservation of marriage, and a foreign policy based on the national interest. While he has not talked much about the importance of resisting ethnic balkanization – none of the major candidates has – he supports enforcing the immigration laws and opposes amnesty. Those are important steps in the right direction."
Scarborough: "How big of an issue will illegal immigration be in these last four weeks in Iowa, a state that seems to care deeply about illegal immigration?"
Governor Romney: "I think it's a big issue here, and I must admit I was a little surprised the first time I came to Iowa for a speech, a Reagan day dinner speech some years ago, and I asked people here, 'What's the biggest issue in Iowa?' And I heard time and again immigration, meaning illegal immigration. And that's something that's really critical. Republicans respect and value legal immigration – but illegal immigration, that is something we have got to stop.
"And I'm pretty proud of my record as the Governor. I took every action I knew how to take to stop illegal immigration. I made sure illegals didn't get driver's licenses. I vetoed a bill that would have given illegals a tuition break in our state university system. I also empowered our State Police to enforce federal immigration laws and, of course, I also insisted on English immersion in our schools. But, at the same time, I tried to help legal immigrants. So I pushed for additional funding for English as a second language, so legal immigrants could learn English, because I think to be successful in America you've got to speak the language of America."
Scarborough: "And you think Mike Huckabee's record on immigration is a failed record?"
Governor Romney: "Well, I think his record on immigration is a real problem for him, and so he's now talking about an entirely different tact that he'd take as President. But his record, I think makes it pretty clear where his heart stands on this. He fought to provide a tuition break, an in-state tuition break for illegals, and he also fought for scholarships for illegals. If you create benefits like that for the children of those who come here illegally, you basically are creating a magnet that draws people across the border or draws them to over stay their visas. That's the wrong thing for America. We need to enforce our laws and have a nation of laws. That's so essential to the nation, a nation of liberty and prosperity, to have laws and to have the rule of law that it's just actually axiomatic that you can't have people who are running states, or for that matter cities like New York City, that put in place sanctuary policies that encourage people to come here and not follow the law."

Today, Gov. Huckabee Says The Jim Gilchrist Endorsement Shows That He Was Not "Soft On Immigration":
Gov. Huckabee: "You know, clearly Iraq we've been through, and I think there could have been questions on immigration, in part, because some major developments. Even though I'm being attacked on it, it was our campaign who got the endorsement of Jim Gilchrest, the founder of the Minutemen Project. So I think the issue of soft on immigration is taken off the table for me." (MSNBC's "Morning Joe," 12/13/07)

"The city of New York, quite frankly, is quite tolerant of undocumented immigration and this shouldn't surprise you because I've been the Mayor for a long time and outspoken on this issue, even nationally, I happen to agree with that." – Mayor Rudy Giuliani (WABC Radio's "Live From City Hall...With Rudy Giuliani," 9/7/01)
But As Mayor, Giuliani Was "Quite Tolerant" Of Illegal Immigration:
In 2001, Mayor Giuliani Boasted That New York City Was "Quite Tolerant Of Undocumented Immigration." GIULIANI: " The city of New York, quite frankly, is quite tolerant of undocumented immigration and this shouldn't surprise you because I've been the Mayor for a long time and outspoken on this issue, even nationally, I happen to agree with that. I think New York City should not deal with undocumented immigrants in a harsh way, I think they make a big contribution to the life of the city and were much better off being sensible and practical about it. And the reality is that restaurants are going to have a certain number of people who are undocumented, you know people that come here to make a living trying to help them selves and their families."

- Daily News: Under Mayor Giuliani, "Illegal" Didn't Have Any Meaning. "But at the same time, federal immigration laws must be enforced strictly. For no nation can allow its borders to be violated with impunity. And state and local governments must help. In New York, that means making the adjective 'illegal' mean something when it appears before the word 'immigrant.' ... In other words, legal or illegal, the law makes no distinction. Then what's the law for?" (Editorial, "Not All Immigrants Are Equal," [New York] Daily News, 3/23/97)
Governor Romney's Plan To Reform Our Immigration System:
Today, In Iowa, Governor Mitt Romney Discussed His Plan To Enforce Our Immigration Laws And Reform Our Immigration System. America's immigration system is broken. Governor Romney believes we must enforce and reform our immigration laws so that we can end illegal immigration. America will always welcome legal immigration, but as a nation we also insist on the rule of law. To reform our immigration system and enhance America's national security, Governor Romney will:
- End The Magnet Of "Sanctuary Cities." Governor Romney will cut back federal funding to cities that are "sanctuaries" for illegal immigrants and who refuse to comply with federal law or aid federal law enforcement. Sanctuary cities tell those who are here illegally that the laws of this country do not matter and become magnets for illegal immigration.
- Promote State And Local Partnerships With Federal Immigration Officials. Governor Romney believes more state and local authorities should work with the federal government to enforce immigration laws. This builds off of his experience in Massachusetts where he deputized the State Police to work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and enforce federal immigration laws.
- Improve Interior Enforcement. Governor Romney will provide additional resources to enforce existing immigration laws throughout the nation. We cannot be serious about our immigration laws until we provide the resources needed to enforce them. Governor Romney supports the Administration's steps to strengthen the enforcement of our current immigration laws.
- Encourage Legal Immigration. Governor Romney will streamline the visa system to recruit and retain skilled workers in high demand by U.S. companies. He will also welcome the best and the brightest from around the world to our universities. We must stop illegal immigration so we can encourage legal immigration.
- Governor Romney: "The scope of our nation's illegal immigration problem requires us to pursue and implement new solutions wherever possible. ... State troopers are highly trained professionals who are prepared to assist the federal government in apprehending immigration violators without disrupting their normal law enforcement routines."

It requires changing human behavior – but it needs to be done for everyone's good. I have the will.

Joining Romney for President, Representative Foxx said, "While the North Carolina primary may not be for several months, our party will begin the process of selecting our nominee in just a few short days. The choice confronting Republicans could not be clearer. We need Governor Romney's leadership, experience, vision and values. He stands for what makes America great. He fought to enforce our immigration laws, reform health care and protect our values. This is leadership I am proud to endorse."

Many Considered McCain-Kennedy "Tantamount To Amnesty." "For many of those same voters, McCain - co-sponsor of the immigration bill that died in Congress earlier this year - is on the wrong side of the issue. The McCain-Kennedy bill - there's nothing like coupling your name to Ted Kennedy's to automatically enrage some conservatives - would create a path to so-called earned citizenship for some of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States. To some voters, earned citizenship for someone who came into the country illegally is tantamount to amnesty." (Ron Claiborne, "McCain Still Dogged By Immigration Issue," ABC News, 12/26/07)
At The Recent CNN/YouTube Debate, Sen. McCain Claimed, "We Never Proposed Amnesty." CNN's ANDERSON COOPER: "Senator McCain, let me bring you back to the question that was asked by the YouTube user. Would you willing to veto any immigration bill that involved amnesty for those who have come here illegally?" SEN. MCCAIN: " Yes, of course, and we never proposed amnesty." (CNN/YouTube, Republican Presidential Candidate Debate, St. Petersburg, FL, 11/28/07)
Yet As Early As 2003, Sen. McCain Was Specifically Calling For Amnesty:
In 2003, McCain Declared, "Amnesty Has To Be An Important Part." "'There are jobs that American workers simply won't do,' McCain said. 'As long as there's a demand for workers, workers are going to come across.' An amnesty program is vital to any immigration legislation that includes a guest-worker program, he said. 'Amnesty has to be an important part because there are people who have lived in this country for 20, 30 or 40 years, who have raised children here and pay taxes here and are not citizens. That has to be a component of it,' he said. 'How can we have a temporary worker program if we're not allowing people who have been here for 30 years to hold jobs here?'" (C. T. Revere, "McCain Pushes Amnesty, Guest-Worker Program," Tucson Citizen, 5/29/03)
Mark Krikorian: "The McCain/Kennedy Amnesty Bill Has Been Unveiled, And It's The Same Hoax We've Fallen For Before." "The McCain/Kennedy amnesty bill has been unveiled, and it's the same hoax we've fallen for before.

Unfortunately, its inadequacies in dealing with illegal immigration -- specifically, in ensuring that 10 years from now we will not have a new cohort of 12 million demanding amnesty -- completely swamp the good done on legal immigration. ... The amnesty is triggered upon presidential certification that these bureaucratic benchmarks are met -- regardless of what is actually happening at the border. What vacuous nonsense."

Sen. McCain Can't Address Criticism Of His Tax And Immigration Policies Because He "Has No Good Response." "Both responses by McCain have this in common -- they fail entirely to address the substance of Romney's criticism. The reason, of course, is that McCain has no good response. He did oppose tax cuts, support for which does lie at the essence of Reagan conservatism. Similarly, he did support comprehensive immigration reform and his line on that support now is a grudging acknowledgement that the American people (though not necessarily McCain) want border security first."

Boston, MA – Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, "Permanently." The ad highlights the critical choice Americans will have to make when it comes to confronting the growing problem of illegal immigration. On this issue, the records are very clear. In the United States Congress, Senator John McCain championed a bill to let every illegal immigrant stay in America permanently. In Massachusetts, Governor Romney opposed driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, vetoed in-state tuition breaks for illegal immigrants and authorized state law enforcement to enforce immigration laws. On enforcing our immigration laws, there's a big difference between Senator McCain and Governor Romney.
"'No' to tuition breaks for illegal immigrants, and he authorized his State Police to enforce federal immigration law.

The Washington Post Called Out Huckabee's Misleading Statements. "On Fox News Wednesday, he was asked about a bill he supported as governor that would have granted tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants. He suggested that he had only wanted to give such children access to scholarships. 'What I supported was the idea that if a student had been in our Arkansas high schools and had done academically well to be able to compete for an academic challenged scholarship which was meritorious then that student should be able to have the same opportunity as anyone else,' Huckabee said. In fact, the initial bill he supported did have a scholarship provision. But that provision was later stripped out, and was not included in the legislation that Huckabee continued to push.

The Washington Post Called Out Gov. Huckabee's Misleading Statements. " In fact, the initial bill he supported did have a scholarship provision. But that provision was later stripped out, and was not included in the legislation that Huckabee continued to push.

Boston, MA – Today, Romney for President launched its newest web ad, "Full-Spectrum Conservative." The ad highlights Governor Romney's conservative platform to build a stronger America. Unlike Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Governor Romney supports the President's tax cuts, opposes the McCain-Feingold bill that limited free speech and opposes any amnesty immigration plans. As the National Review wrote, Governor Romney is "a full-spectrum conservative." Script and viewing links are below.
- Sen. John Ensign (R-NV): "'There was a felony they were committing, and now they can't be prosecuted. That sounds like amnesty to me,' said Sen. John Ensign, the Nevada Republican who offered the amendment yesterday to strip out those provisions of the immigration reform bill. 'It just boggles the mind how people could be against this amendment.'" (Charles Hurt, "Illegals Granted Social Security," The Washington Times, 5/19/06)
Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) Said The Bill Would Allow Illegals "To Use Their Past Illegal Work To Qualify For Social Security Benefits." "Top Ten Reasons to Oppose The Senate Amnesty Bill... 6. Social Security Benefits, Tax Credits for Illegal Work ... The Senate rejected Senator Ensign's amendment that would have prevented Social Security benefits from being awarded to immigrants for time that they worked illegally in the United States. If the immigration compromise bill before the Senate were enacted into law, an estimated 12 million illegal workers would be able to use their past illegal work to qualify for Social Security benefits." (Sen. Tom Coburn, "Dr. Coburn Votes Against Senate Amnesty," Press Release, 5/25/06; http://coburn.senate.gov/)
Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) Said The Bill Allowed Social Security To Those Who "Stole Identifies To Work In The United States Illegally." "Below are the key problems that remain in the Senate immigration bill, S. 2611... Rewards illegal document fraud by allowing Social Security payments for those who stole identities to work in the United States illegally." (Sen. John Cornyn, "Cornyn Statement On Senate Immigration Bill Passage," Press Release, 5/25/06)
Conservative Economist Stephen Moore: "I Do Not Think They Should Be Eligible For Social Security Until They Start Working Here Legally." MOORE: "I'm very much in favor of immigration. But I don't think that illegal immigrants should be rewarded for the time they were working in the United States when they were illegal ... And so I do not think they should be eligible for Social Security until they start working here legally." (CNBC's "Kudlow &amp; Company," 5/19/06)
The Washington Times Editorial: Senators Moved Social Security Closer To Insolvency By Offering Benefits To Illegals. "On its way to bankruptcy, Social Security will get there a bit sooner... During the Senate debate on immigration reform in May, Mr. Ensign proposed that no illegal alien whose status would be adjusted by the Senate bill be permitted to receive Social Security benefits as a result of unlawful activity. ... In addition to Messrs. McCain, Hagel and Brownback, other still-serving Republicans who opposed the Ensign amendment, which lost by a 50-49 vote, included Sens. Lindsey Graham, Richard Lugar, Mel Martinez, Arlen Specter, Ted Stevens and George Voinovich." (Editorial, "Social Security Siphon," The Washington Times, 1/5/07)
It's not just the White House they're talking about, it is Washington. They look at what's happening there and they say, 'How come Washington can't deal with illegal immigration? How come Washington can't build better jobs for us? How come Washington can't help us become energy independent? How come Washington can't get health insurance for all of our citizens without making it HillaryCare or socialized medicine?' Washington is broken, and we're going to change that.

1. Defending His Amnesty Bill, Sen. McCain Lost His Temper And "Screamed, 'F*ck You!' At Texas Sen. John Cornyn" (R-TX). "Presidential hopeful John McCain - who has been dogged for years by questions about his volcanic temper - erupted in an angry, profanity-laced tirade at a fellow Republican senator, sources told The Post yesterday. In a heated dispute over immigration-law overhaul, McCain screamed, 'F--- you!' at Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who had been raising concerns about the legislation. 'This is chickens---stuff,' McCain snapped at Cornyn, according to several people in the room off the Senate floor Thursday. 'You've always been against this bill, and you're just trying to derail it.'" (Charles Hurt, "Raising McCain," New York Post, 5/19/07)
Manchester, NH – Today, led by Congressman Tom Tancredo (R-CO) and Maricopa County [AZ] Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a group of national and local leaders held a press conference stressing the importance of ending illegal immigration. The leaders touched on Governor Romney's record of enforcing immigration laws, his proposals to end illegal immigration and Senator John McCain's (R-AZ) past support for giving Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants.
Sheriff Joe Arpaio: "Unfortunately, We Have A U.S. Senator From That Important State [Arizona] That Doesn't Give Much Emphasis To This Most Important Problem." "I like his [Governor Romney's] stance on illegal immigration. If you recall, he's probably the first Governor that did make arrangements with ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) for that type of training that ICE and we do. I give him a lot of credit for that. ... It is an important problem in the state of Arizona and the whole country. That's one reason I support the Governor, versus many other reasons too. Unfortunately, we have a U.S. Senator from that important state [Arizona] that doesn't give much emphasis to this most important problem."

National Review's Rich Lowry: "[Romney] spoke forcefully and put the case for himself as the reformist businessman in the best possible light. I think he basically dominated the first hour, and fell off a tab after that, but otherwise was truly excellent. His best performance yet, in very high pressure circumstances. His answers on taxes, job creation, and immigration were top notch."

Politico's Jonathan Martin: "Overall, Romney was much more effective at driving his message this evening, taking advantage of numerous opportunities to talk up his new theme of bringing change to Washington.

(Jonathan Martin, "From Smackdown To Somnolent," Politico, http://www.politico.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
They've heard Washington say that they're going to stop illegal immigration, but they haven't. They've heard Washington say that they're going to get us off of our dependence on foreign oil, but they haven't.
Governor Romney: "You throw back to the principles of the Reagan era. There's no question about that. But Washington is fundamentally broken not because it doesn't have principles, but because Republicans and Democrats just can't get the job done. They've been failing to get immigration fixed. They've failed to get us independent of foreign oil. They failed to get health care for our citizens. They failed to reduce taxes on the middle-class. These are not Republican or Democrat issues. They're the issues of incapability of doing the job at hand, and you have to have somebody who goes to Washington who's not so use to the Senate Cloakroom and all the lobbyists there that they're paralyzed to get the job done for the American people. I spent my life changing things, in business, at the Olympics and in government. And I'm going to change things in Washington."
- Governor Romney: "Folks who come from Michigan recognize, like people across this country, that Washington has failed them time and again. That Washington has made promises and not delivered on those promises and they are tired of waiting for change. And we will bring change. You heard about illegal immigration, they promised change there, they haven't delivered. You heard about reducing the tax burden on the middle class and burdens on the middle class, they haven't delivered on that. We've talked about improving our schools, that hasn't been delivered. Getting health care for all of our citizens, that hasn't been delivered. And one, that as you know, Michigan cares about most deeply, and that is rebuilding and strengthening our economy, helping elevate wages, growing our middle class, making sure that we lead the world in technology and innovation and design and patents. It's been promised time and again, and I will actually get the job done because I have done it before." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks, 1/9/08)
Governor Romney Will Enforce Our Laws And Reform Our Immigration System. America's immigration system is broken, but for too long all our leaders in Washington have done is talk about ending illegal immigration. Governor Romney believes we must enforce and reform our immigration laws so that we can end illegal immigration. To end illegal immigration, Governor Romney will:
- Promote State And Local Partnerships With Federal Immigration Officials. More state and local authorities should work with the federal government to enforce immigration laws.
- Improve Interior Enforcement. Governor Romney will provide additional resources to enforce existing immigration laws throughout the nation.
McCain-Kennedy isn't the answer. As governor, I took a very different approach. I authorized our state police to enforce immigration laws. I vetoed a tuition break for illegals and said no to driver's licenses. McCain-Kennedy gives benefits to illegals that would cost taxpayers millions. And more importantly, amnesty didn't work 20 years ago, and it won't work today.
Sixth, as we finally and belatedly secure the border and solve the problem of illegal immigration, we must reaffirm our appreciation of legal immigration. We are a nation of immigrants and refugees, and they have contributed a great deal to our culture of hard work, entrepreneurship, faith in God, love of family, and respect for human life.
Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on Senator John McCain's (R-AZ) immigration remarks in Miami, Florida:
"The immigration approach proposed by Senators McCain and Kennedy falls short of a workable solution to an important problem. I respect Senator McCain, but my opposition to his bill is a matter of principled disagreement about policies and priorities related to enforcement of our immigration laws.
"In reforming our immigration system, we must meet three priorities. First, we can and must secure our borders. Second, our country must have an enforceable employment verification system. Third, in reforming our immigration system, we must do so in a way that rewards immigrants who obey the laws and guards against providing special incentives for those who show no regard for them."
Governor Romney: "I believe it's important to end illegal immigration so we can maintain and encourage legal immigration. Immigration is good for this country; it's helped us over our history. We need immigration to provide some of the skills that we may miss, migrant workers, cultural advantages. It's a great source of vitality for America to have legal immigration, but illegal immigration – that we need to bring an end to." (KCMO's "Morning Show With Chris Stigall," 5/22/07)
Governor Mitt Romney: "Well, I was very pleased. A couple of things happened. One was Senator McCain and I were able to distinguish ourselves on the issue of immigration in a way that I think will be lasting in people's minds. The other was with regards to Mayor Giuliani. I speak about three-legs to the Republican stool being necessary to win a general election, which is a conservative base in terms of military, economic and family and family values. And he talks about a two-legged stool. And so I think those distinctions are going to be memorable and probably set a bit of the course for the future of this campaign."
Cameron: "You mention the distinctions between yourself and Senator McCain on immigration. Obviously, he's pushing the immigration reform bill in Congress, one of the sponsors of it, and you're opposed to that. We were led to believe that yesterday was going to be a bit of a confrontation between the two of you and it might have been a bit feisty and yet it didn't happen. It seemed to be much more decorous. Why?"
Cameron: "He might quibble with the idea that there's an agreement. Yesterday, he made it very clear that he thinks those who are criticizing the proposals, it's time to put up or shut up and come up with a plan. When do we see Mitt Romney's immigration treatise?"
To watch Governor Romney address the need for immigration reform, please see:
The Democrats have a plan for illegal immigration as well. It's amnesty. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and their colleagues insist that every illegal immigrant become a legal permanent resident of this country. Some people think that their position has less to do with compassion than with calculation - they hope these illegal immigrants will vote them in power forever.
But this is not about power or politics. It is about sovereignty and security. And it is about fairness. Millions of applicants are waiting to come here legally, to be joined with family members, to bring education and skill that will strengthen our nation, not burden it. Legal immigration is a boon to our nation. We are made a greater nation when immigrants come here legally, seeking opportunity.

Governor Romney's Plan To Reform Our Immigration System:
Today, In New Hampshire, Governor Mitt Romney Discussed His Plan To Reform America's Immigration System. America's immigration system is broken. Governor Romney believes we must reform our immigration laws so that we can end illegal immigration. America will always welcome legal immigration, but as a nation we also insist on the rule of law. To reform our immigration system and enhance America's national security, Governor Romney will:
- End The Magnet Of "Sanctuary Cities." Governor Romney will cut back federal funding to cities that are "sanctuaries" for illegal immigrants and refuse to comply with federal law or aid federal law enforcement. Sanctuary cities tell those who are here illegally that the laws of this country do not matter and become magnets for illegal immigration.
- Promote State And Local Partnerships With Federal Immigration Officials. Governor Romney believes more state and local authorities should work with the federal government to enforce immigration laws. This builds off of his experience in Massachusetts where he deputized the State Police to work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and enforce federal immigration laws.
- Improve Interior Enforcement. Governor Romney will provide additional resources to enforce existing immigration laws throughout the nation. We cannot be serious about our immigration laws until we provide the resources needed to enforce them. Governor Romney supports the Administration's steps to strengthen the enforcement of our current immigration laws.
- Encourage Legal Immigration. Governor Romney will streamline the visa system to recruit and retain skilled workers in high demand by U.S. companies. He will also welcome the best and the brightest from around the world to our universities. We must stop illegal immigration so we can encourage legal immigration.
- Governor Romney: "The scope of our nation's illegal immigration problem requires us to pursue and implement new solutions wherever possible. State troopers are highly trained professionals who are prepared to assist the federal government in apprehending immigration violators without disrupting their normal law enforcement routines." (Jonathan Saltzman, "Romney OK's Pact So Troopers Can Arrest Illegal Immigrants," The Boston Globe, 12/14/06)

Many Considered McCain-Kennedy "Tantamount To Amnesty." "For many of those same voters, McCain - co-sponsor of the immigration bill that died in Congress earlier this year - is on the wrong side of the issue. The McCain-Kennedy bill - there's nothing like coupling your name to Ted Kennedy's to automatically enrage some conservatives - would create a path to so-called earned citizenship for some of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States. To some voters, earned citizenship for someone who came into the country illegally is tantamount to amnesty." (Ron Claiborne, "McCain Still Dogged By Immigration Issue," ABC News, 12/26/07)
At The Recent CNN/YouTube Debate, Sen. McCain Claimed, "We Never Proposed Amnesty." CNN's ANDERSON COOPER: "Senator McCain, let me bring you back to the question that was asked by the YouTube user. Would you willing to veto any immigration bill that involved amnesty for those who have come here illegally?" SEN. MCCAIN: " Yes, of course, and we never proposed amnesty." (CNN/YouTube, Republican Presidential Candidate Debate, St. Petersburg, FL, 11/28/07)
Yet As Early As 2003, Sen. McCain Was Specifically Calling For Amnesty:
In 2003, McCain Declared, "Amnesty Has To Be An Important Part." "'There are jobs that American workers simply won't do,' McCain said. 'As long as there's a demand for workers, workers are going to come across.' An amnesty program is vital to any immigration legislation that includes a guest-worker program, he said. 'Amnesty has to be an important part because there are people who have lived in this country for 20, 30 or 40 years, who have raised children here and pay taxes here and are not citizens. That has to be a component of it,' he said. 'How can we have a temporary worker program if we're not allowing people who have been here for 30 years to hold jobs here?'" (C. T. Revere, "McCain Pushes Amnesty, Guest-Worker Program," Tucson Citizen, 5/29/03)

Making today's announcement, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher issued the following statement: "Our country is facing great challenges. Among the most ominous is illegal immigration, which has been permitted to spin out of control for the last decade and a half.

"It is an honor to have the support of Sheriff Babeu," said Mitt Romney. "His efforts working to protect our border are critical to lowering crime, reducing illegal immigration, and stopping both drug and human trafficking. Sheriff Babeu has been a leader in the call for the federal government to secure the border. As President, I will work with leaders like Sheriff Babeu to protect our Southern border, provide the required assistance from the federal government, and put an end to the magnets that cause illegal immigration."
Announcing his support, Sheriff Babeu said, "Securing our border is an important part of our national security – Mitt Romney understands this. He also understands that magnets like in-state tuition for illegal immigrants don't stop illegal immigration, they only make it worse. Of all the candidates, Mitt Romney has shown that he is the most committed to securing the border and I look forward to working with him to do this."
Sheriff Paul Babeu is the Sheriff of Pinal County in Arizona. Babeu heads a department of 700 and has worked to cut the budget, reorganize leadership, and reduce the response time from his department. Babeu has been a national leader on the need to secure our border and stop illegal immigration and drug and human trafficking. This year, Sheriff Babeu was named Sheriff of the Year by the National Sheriffs' Association.

"I'm so proud to earn Kris's support," said Mitt Romney. "Kris has been a true leader on securing our borders and stopping the flow of illegal immigration into this country. We need more conservative leaders like Kris willing to stand up for the rule of law. With Kris on the team, I look forward to working with him to take forceful steps to curtail illegal immigration and to support states like South Carolina and Arizona that are stepping forward to address this problem."
"We need a president who will finally put a stop to a problem that has plagued our country for a generation: millions of illegal aliens coming into the country and taking jobs from United States citizens and legal aliens, while consuming hundreds of billions of dollars in public benefits at taxpayer expense," said Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. "Illegal immigration is a nightmare for America's economy and America's national security. Mitt Romney is the candidate who will finally secure the borders and put a stop to the magnets, like in-state tuition, that encourage illegal aliens to remain in our country unlawfully.  He is also the candidate who will stand shoulder to shoulder with the states that are fighting to restore the rule of law.  I am pleased to stand with this true conservative."
