Announcing his support, Sheriff Babeu said, "Securing our border is an important part of our national security – Mitt Romney understands this. He also understands that magnets like in-state tuition for illegal immigrants don't stop illegal immigration, they only make it worse. Of all the candidates, Mitt Romney has shown that he is the most committed to securing the border and I look forward to working with him to do this."
Since its inception, the Herzliya Conference has become a leading and world-renowned summit of Israeli and international leaders for the discussion of Israel's national security. Participants at the Conference include: government officials, Knesset members and ministers, defense officials, business leaders, senior academics, media, representatives of leading Jewish organizations, and dignitaries from abroad.

Republican principles are also needed in national security. Tonight, I'd like to consider two critical regions where the strength and resolve of our foreign policy is being tested: first, in the Middle East. And second, in Latin America.
- Strengthen Civilian Efforts And Strategic Planning: Many of our civilian national security and foreign policy structures were created decades ago. The lack of adequate planning and preparation for Iraq is one illustration of the breakdown of these Cold War capabilities. We need to ensure our civilian instruments have the ability to build joint efforts among our civilian agencies, and we need to empower Regional Deputies with clear lines of authority, budgets and responsibility to develop and execute regional plans and strategies. The National Security Council (NSC) needs strengthened capabilities to strategically integrate all elements of national power. NSC staff must be empowered and accountable for reaching out to divergent viewpoints and challenging policies and proposals.

Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced that retired Major General James "Spider" Marks will join Romney for President as a Senior Adviser for National Security Affairs. General Marks will advise Governor Romney on issues pertaining to national security, the United States military and foreign policy.
Joining Romney for President, General Marks said, "Governor Romney has been outspoken in his commitment to our men and women in the military. Our troops need more support from Washington and Governor Romney will ensure that they have the resources they need to defend this country. I am proud to be joining Governor Romney's campaign. On national security issues, the Governor has distinguished himself as a true leader ready to invest in our national defense."
- Achieving Energy Independence. Energy independence is vital to our national defense and our economic security. Governor Romney has called for a bold and far-reaching research initiative to create new, economic sources of clean energy. We must invest in renewable and alternative fuels such as ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, biodiesel, and liquefied coal. American resolve and investment are essential for energy security and national security.
Governor Romney Will Strengthen Strategic Planning And Challenge Bureaucratic "Group Think." Many of our civilian national security and foreign policy structures were created decades ago. We need strengthened capabilities to strategically integrate all elements of national power in planning and budgeting, as was seen in the lack for strategic planning for post-war Iraq. The National Security Council (NSC) especially needs to be strengthened to achieve these goals. NSC staff must be empowered and accountable for reaching out to divergent viewpoints and challenging policies and proposals. To ensure that we are always prepared, we must constantly challenge bureaucratic "group think" and assumptions.

- Three Of The United States' Top Four Energy Suppliers Are In Our Hemisphere. Ensuring that the United States has a stable supply of energy is key to our economic and national security.
Third, We Must Transform And Strengthen Our Civilian International Efforts To Meet A New Generation Of Challenges. Many of our civilian national security and foreign policy structures were created decades ago to confront Cold War threats. Building on the Goldwater-Nichols military reforms of the 1980s, we need to ensure that our civilian instruments of national power have the ability to build joint efforts among our civilian agencies and empower Regional Deputies with clear lines of authority, budgets and responsibility to develop and execute regional plans and strategies. We must also constantly challenge bureaucratic "group think" and revitalize our national security structures so we have the capabilities needed to meet 21st century challenges.

Given A Chance To Repudiate The MoveOn Ad, Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) Instead Attacked The Mission In Iraq. CHARLIE ROSE: "Did you approve or what did you think of the Moveon.org advertisement about Gen. Petraeus?" SEN. BARACK OBAMA: " Well, I'll be honest with you. My general view listening to Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker is that they are able, competent people who are performing an impossible task. That they have been provided an assignment, a mission by the president that basically involves continuing the same course that we've been on for the last several years. And my view is that the person who is ultimately accountable for these critical national security decisions is the president. And I am less interested in the motives or what Gen. Petraeus or Ambassador Crocker are responsible for than I am for what the president is responsible for, and that is the mission that has been assigned to those people. I think the mission is the failure." ("Obama: 'Sinning' Is Necessary To Compete In Politics," Slate, 7/13/07)
Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement regarding last night's Democratic presidential debate and Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY) on national security:
"Once again, Senator Clinton has demonstrated a fundamental weakness when it comes to our country's national security. When presented with a national security scenario at last night's debate, she vacillated and stated clearly that she would not give our men and women the tools they need to gain critical information. As President, I believe that when it comes to saving American lives we should and must use enhanced interrogation techniques."

We're accustomed as a people to measuring our national security in terms of missiles and aircraft and defense spending.

You cannot have a first-tier military and have a second-tier economy. The Soviet Union learned that the hard way and Ronald Reagan taught it to them.
Governor Romney: "You know, I'm not sure who's most to blame. You can point fingers in lots of directions, from the leadership in the state, to the leadership in Washington to leadership of unions and management. But the key is that somebody's got to do something about it. You've watched a state in a one-state recession for almost a decade, and no one talks about what to do to help Michigan. When the nation begins to feel a hiccup, we all talk about a stimulus package, the need to put money in the hands of consumers and so forth. But when Michigan has been suffering for 10 years, people have sat by and been somewhat idle. In my view, we're going to have to make sure that the U.S. auto industry does not continue to shed jobs, and cause the state to go further and further into a very troubling situation. It's important to us for economic reasons, for personal reasons, to help families that are hurting, and also because as a nation, we do not want to see the auto industry continue to shrink and ultimately disappear. It's a national security issue for us, and it is an economic issue."
Background On Congressman Dana Rohrabacher:
Congressman Dana Rohrabacher Is Serving His Ninth Term Representing California's 46th Congressional District. Representative Rohrabacher is the Ranking Member of the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee of the House Committee on International Relations and is a senior member of the House Committee on Science. He's noted for his principled decision-making, commitment to issues on illegal immigration, national security and responsible economic policy. Throughout his years in Congress, Representative Rohrabacher has been a strong voice for fiscal restraint and has earned the praise of the National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business.
"Our nominee must be able to win in November. Our quality of life and our national security depend on it."
Making today's announcement, Governor Romney said, "Throughout his distinguished legal career, including his 18 years of service as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, during which he led the fight against radical jihadists, Andrew McCarthy has been a champion for protecting the American people. With his experience, Andy's counsel on national security and related legal matters will be invaluable in my campaign for our nation's highest office. I am greatly honored to have his wise counsel and deep experience in my campaign."
"I supported, Rudy Giuliani, who hired me as a young prosecutor, because of his intelligence, executive competence, and commitment to our national security. I see in Governor Romney those same qualities. They are the qualities we need to face our nation's challenges, and they are why I am so proud to support him."
Senator Rick Santorum: "I spent an hour and a half with Mitt Romney about five, six months ago. And, we spent an hour and a half. As you know, I'm at Ethics and Public Policy and I'm working on the Jihad issue. And I spent an hour and a half with this guy and I can tell you, he understands it. We talked almost all that hour and a half about Iran. He was not only curious, but had some very interesting insights and ideas. He understands the national security piece. I walked away from there saying, 'Ok, I can check that box. This guy really gets it. He understands it. He has a depth of knowledge about it.' He knows what it means to be a Commander-in-Chief under these circumstances, as John McCain effectively does in fighting the war overseas. But just as importantly is fighting the war here at home, where John McCain has had a horrible record in protecting us here at home."
Announcing the coalition leaders, Governor Romney said, 'Almost three decades ago, Ronald Reagan united social conservatives, fiscal conservatives, and national security conservatives to forge the Republican Party that we know today. I am proud that these North Dakota leaders represent each part of the Reagan Coalition because that coalition is what has kept the White House in Republican hands for 20 of the last 28 years. To win in November, we must stay true to President Reagan's vision, and I am the only candidate that can unite fiscal, social, and national security conservatives to lead us to victory over the Democrat nominee.'

Announcing his support, Sheriff Babeu said, "Securing our border is an important part of our national security – Mitt Romney understands this. He also understands that magnets like in-state tuition for illegal immigrants don't stop illegal immigration, they only make it worse. Of all the candidates, Mitt Romney has shown that he is the most committed to securing the border and I look forward to working with him to do this."
"Mitt Romney won tonight's debate by demonstrating that he is the best candidate to restore our military, defend American interests, and foster peace abroad. Governor Romney deeply understands that preserving U.S. national security requires a strong military. In the face of multiple, massive, and dangerous cuts to the defense budget under President Obama, America needs a principled and determined leader in the White House who will keep faith with our uniformed men and women, repair our special relationships with friends and allies, and ensure America's leadership role in the world. That leader is Mitt Romney."
"Mitt Romney has had the lifelong experiences needed to turn around our economy," said Senator Murkowski. "Whether it was his ability to turn around the Massachusetts economy or turn around businesses in the private sector, Mitt Romney has demonstrated the leadership that we need in the White House to get the country on the right track. He has also laid out a plan to get our country on the path toward energy independence. Mitt Romney understands the importance of Alaska as a leader in our country's energy production and I look forward to working with him on such an important economic and national security matter."
"Congressman Rogers' work as a leader on national security issues has been important to the safety of our country," said Mitt Romney. "Standing up to terrorists around the world, stopping Iran's nuclear program, and maintaining our relationships with our allies will require the leadership that Congressman Rogers has displayed. I look forward to working with him both in this campaign and in Washington so that we can bring jobs back to our home state and keep our country secure."
"Mitt Romney has displayed the conservative leadership throughout this campaign and his life that will be needed to fix our economy and maintain America's standing as the most powerful country in the world," said Congressman Rogers. "I am confident that Michigan will be on Mitt Romney's mind every day he is President and he will work hard to get Michigan back on track. Mitt Romney's plan to restore our country's fiscal health is important not just for economic growth, but is also vital for our nation's national security interests. An America that faces economic and budget problems will not be able to project power across the world or contain countries and groups who wish to harm us and our allies."
Congressman Rogers represents Michigan's 8th congressional district. Congressman Rogers is the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Rogers has been a leader on issues vital to national security such as fighting the spread of terrorism, containing the Iranian nuclear threat, and protecting Americans from bio-terror attacks. Prior to his election to Congress, Rogers was a member of the Michigan Senate, U.S. Army and Federal Bureau of Investigation. Rogers is co-founder of a small home building company.
"We need a president who will finally put a stop to a problem that has plagued our country for a generation: millions of illegal aliens coming into the country and taking jobs from United States citizens and legal aliens, while consuming hundreds of billions of dollars in public benefits at taxpayer expense," said Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. "Illegal immigration is a nightmare for America's economy and America's national security. Mitt Romney is the candidate who will finally secure the borders and put a stop to the magnets, like in-state tuition, that encourage illegal aliens to remain in our country unlawfully.  He is also the candidate who will stand shoulder to shoulder with the states that are fighting to restore the rule of law.  I am pleased to stand with this true conservative."
"Of all the candidates, Mitt Romney possesses the strongest vision for America's leadership role in the world, and I am proud to endorse him," Ambassador Bolton said. "President Obama has sapped America's credibility abroad, weakened our military and failed to lead on issues vital to U.S. national security. President Obama has left America exposed to ever increasing threats. Mitt Romney will restore our military, repair relations with our closest allies, and ensure that no adversary—including Iran—ever questions American resolve."
"I am honored to have Congressman Turner on my team," said Mitt Romney. "He is a committed public servant who has stood up for fiscal responsibility in Washington while also keeping a watchful eye on our national security. Ohio will be an important state in this upcoming election. I look forward to working with Congressman Turner as I campaign across the country to grow the economy and create jobs."
"It is an honor to have the support of such a committed public servant," said Mitt Romney. "Bringing fiscal sanity to Washington is critical for our country's future economic health and national security. In the United States Senate, Senator Portman has been a leader in the fight for a balanced budget and I look forward to working with him to make the federal government simpler, smaller, and smarter."
Mitt Romney recognizes the wider threat to freedom posed by the anti-American Bolivarian movement across Latin America that is led by Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and the Castro brothers. This movement threatens the principles enshrined in the Inter-American Democratic Charter and poses a serious national security threat to U.S. regional allies and the U.S. homeland in the form of an enhanced drug-terror nexus. Mitt Romney will pursue a resolute policy toward Latin America that will include:
The U.S. space program is a strategic national asset, which makes critical contributions to our scientific knowledge, technological innovation, economic competitiveness, national security, and international leadership.  We have watched with dismay as President Obama dismantled the structure that was guiding both the government and commercial space sectors, while providing no purpose or vision or mission. This failure of leadership has thrust the space program into disarray and triggered a dangerous erosion of our technical workforce and capabilities. In short, we have a space program unworthy of a great nation.
As president, Mitt Romney will facilitate close collaboration not only within the government's civil and national security space sectors, but also with the private sector and with research institutions. He will create conditions for a strong and competitive commercial space industry that can contribute greatly to our national capabilities and goals. And he will ensure that NASA returns its focus to the project of manned space exploration that uniquely affirms American strength and values around the globe. Under his leadership, America will once again lead the world in space.
Announcing his support, Governor Wilson said, "Mitt Romney is an enthusiastic believer in American exceptionalism and has been a spectacular example of it: Mitt has been a success in creating American private sector jobs, a success as the rescuer of the Salt Lake City Olympic games, and as a public chief executive as the Republican governor in the challenging environment of heavily Democratic Massachusetts. It is clear that he will be a success in the White House---as the strong leader America so desperately needs to reverse the unprecedented and utterly irresponsible borrowing, taxing and spending of the Obama administration. And as the most electable top of our ticket, his candidacy will attract the support of Republican, Independent and wise Democratic voters---and is rightly seen by down-ticket Republican candidates as the nominee most beneficial to them in their own races. He is the leader we need to rescue this great nation from the tragedy of a second Obama term that threatens grave and perhaps irreparable harm to both our economy and our national security. Mitt Romney will provide the leadership to create the confidence and certainty of judgment needed to stimulate investment that creates jobs rather than green taxpayer-funded bankruptcies. He will restore America's strength and credibility, and win back respect for America from both our friends and our enemies."
President Obama does not possess that same understanding. He is placing our Navy — and our national security — in a precarious position. The Navy is far too small to meet its global responsibilities and currently consists of fewer ships than at any time since World War I.
President Obama's plan to scale back our naval power is curious, because the latest defense strategic guidance released by the Pentagon this month makes much of a pivot to Asia and the robust naval and air power necessary to retain a U.S. presence in that region. That portion of the document adhered closely to the strategic findings of the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel, a panel on which we sat and which Bill Perry, Bill Clinton's Secretary of Defense, and Steve Hadley, George W. Bush's national security adviser, led.
Right now, voters are mostly concerned with the economy. But troubling events in the Middle East could easily shift the focus of the election to national security. We are confident that Romney has the temperament, judgment and maturity to make a case for his presidential candidacy even if the election issues become more global.

Santorum Also Praised Governor Romney's Conservatism On National Security: "This Guy Really Gets It ... He Knows What It Means To Be A Commander-In-Chief Under These Circumstances." SANTORUM: "He understands the national security piece. I walked away from there saying i can check that box. This guy really gets it. He understands it. He has a depth of knowledge about it. He knows what it means to be a commander-in-chief under these circumstances." (Laura Ingraham Show, 2/1/08)
Greenville News: "Romney is best equipped of the Republican candidates to help this country get its financial house in order, to rein in a federal government inclined to add crushing regulations, to free business capital to create jobs and to improve the lives of Americans up and down the economic ladder. He is thoughtful when it comes to protecting the country, enhancing its national security and improving its relationship with trusted allies. At the same time, his executive experience in the business world and in state government gives him an undeniable advantage in this Republican primary." (Editorial, "Romney Best Choice For Republicans," Greenville News, 1/15/12)
"The election in November is as important an election as I can remember," said Attorney General Ashcroft. "At home, we face economic and fiscal peril and abroad, we face uncertainty in volatile regions of the world. Our country needs an iron-willed president of integrity to lead us through these troubled times. No other candidate stands out for his executive leadership experience or ability to accomplish difficult tasks as does Mitt Romney.  As a conservative who served as Governor of Missouri during the Reagan revolution, I admire Mitt's record of fiscal responsibility, lower taxes, and defense of traditional values in a politically difficult state for a Republican. I had the opportunity to work with Mitt Romney on issues of national security during the 2002 Winter Olympics and counted him as a trustworthy, effective ally in the fight against terror while he was Governor of Massachusetts.  I know that the lives and liberties of the American people will be secure with him as President. I am grateful for the opportunity to support him and urge all voters who want to restore America to her preeminent place of leadership in values, strength and prosperity to support him now and in November."
Let's start with taxes. By their very nature, they reduce our freedom. Their only role in a free economy should be to fund services that are absolutely essential, such as national security, education, and the care of those who cannot care for themselves.
Iraq and Afghanistan: Contrary to the recommendations of your military commanders, you withdrew American forces from Iraq without leaving an appropriate training force behind. And contrary to the recommendations of your military commanders, you have begun to draw down American forces in Afghanistan according to a politically driven timetable that makes no strategic sense. Stability in both countries is now at greater risk. If you are reelected, would "flexibility" lead you to abandon completely American commitments, notwithstanding the enormous sacrifices American forces have made, and with little regard for our national security?
In a democracy, no issues are more important than those pertaining to national security. The American people deserve full and frank answers to these questions, or at least the same level of candor you have offered to Russia's leaders.
Moscow has rewarded these gifts with nothing but obstructionism at the United Nations on a whole raft of issues. It has continued to arm the regime of Syria's vicious dictator and blocked multilateral efforts to stop the ongoing carnage there. Across the board, it has been a thorn in our side on questions vital to America's national security. For three years, the sum total of President Obama's policy toward Russia has been: "We give, Russia gets."
On joining the campaign as a Senior Adviser, Ed Gillespie said, "I'm excited to join Mitt Romney's campaign team. His plan to reduce taxes, balance the federal budget, strengthen our national security and protect innocent human life stands in sharp contrast to the ruinous policies of President Obama. His record of strong leadership as governor and proven history of great accomplishment in both the public and private sectors show he has the ability to make the tough decisions needed to be a good president, which is sadly missing right now."
Congressman Mac Thornberry represents Texas' 13th district. Congressman Thornberry sits on the House Armed Services Committee and Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He is one of Congress' leading experts on national security and helped create the legislation that would form the current Department of Homeland Security.
By their very nature, taxes reduce our freedom. Their only role in a free economy should be to fund services that are absolutely essential, such as national security, education, and the care of those who cannot care for themselves.
"It is a privilege to have the support of two such outstanding public servants," said Mitt Romney today. "There are few leaders who have such distinguished records working in high office to protect this nation. From their time as young officers in the Navy to their many years advising presidents on a broad array of national security issues, Frank and Steve have served our country with great distinction. I am honored to have their support and grateful to have their counsel."
President Obama's Former DNC Chair Tim Kaine: "I Hope The Department Of Interior And The Obama Administration Will Recognize The Bipartisan Support For Developing Virginia's Offshore Energy Resources." "'I believe that clean, renewable energy will power our future. In the meantime, responsible domestic production can help create jobs, generate revenue, improve national security, and address our energy needs while clean energy technology is developed,' Kaine wrote. 'I hope the Department of Interior and the Obama administration will recognize the bipartisan support for developing Virginia's offshore energy resources and add Virginia to the current lease sale.'" ("Virginia Left Out Of Offshore Drilling," The Fredericksburg Free Lance Star, 11/8/11)
"President Obama likes to say that 'we can't wait' to solve America's problems, but he has done nothing but wait when it comes to America's energy security. His opposition to developing domestic energy resources imperils our economic future and our national security. While President Obama is content with endless 'studying' and delay, Mitt Romney has a plan that will put Americans to back work, pump billions of dollars into the economy, and strengthen our energy security for decades to come." -Lanhee Chen, Romney for President Policy Director
Last year, President Obama signed into law a budget scheme that threatens to saddle the U.S. military with nearly $1 trillion in cuts over the next 10 years. President Obama's own defense secretary, Leon Panetta, has called cuts of this magnitude "devastating" to our national security. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has plainly said that such a reduction means "we would not any longer be a global power." Despite these warnings, the Obama administration has pledged to veto an attempt to replace these cuts with savings in other areas.
President Obama, At Cuyahoga Community College In 2010: "I'll Spend The Next Year Making The Tough Choices Necessary To Further Reduce Our Deficit And Lower Our Debt" OBAMA: "But I am absolutely committed to fiscal responsibility, which is why I've already proposed freezing all discretionary spending unrelated to national security for the next three years. And once the bipartisan fiscal commission finishes its work, I'll spend the next year making the tough choices necessary to further reduce our deficit and lower our debt -- whether I get help from the other side or not." (President Barack Obama, Remarks at Cuyahoga Community College, Parma, OH, 9/8/10)
"After nearly four years of ignoring our friends in Latin America, it is no wonder that President Obama fails to understand the disruptive activities of Hugo Chavez's Venezuela. Working hand in glove with the Castro brothers, Chavez has been working to fund and to foment anti-American hatred across Latin America. He's formed partnerships with rogue states around the world, including Syria and Iran. He's welcomed Hezbollah operatives into our backyard. He's crushed democratic forces in his own country and encouraged narco-terrorists throughout the region. When President Obama says, as he did in a television interview on Monday, that Chavez has not had 'a serious national security impact on us,' he's dead wrong. Such a statement by an American president itself damages U.S. national security by emboldening one of the most anti-American actors on the international stage."
"I was stunned by his comments, and shocked by them. This is Hugo Chavez, this is Venezuela. This is Chavez who has invited Iran in, who has invited Hezbollah. Hezbollah, of course, being a surrogate and a proxy for Iran would potentially have access to weapons that could be used against us. ... The idea that this nation, this president doesn't pose a national security threat to this country is simply naïve. It's an extraordinary admission on the part of this president to be completely out of touch with what's happened in Latin America." — Mitt Romney
"Five years ago, campaigning against Barack Obama for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton said that Barack Obama's views of Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan strongman, were 'irresponsible and frankly naïve.' That was right in 2007, and it's still right today. In an interview earlier this week, President Obama gave a pass to Chavez, explaining that 'overall my sense is that what Mr. Chavez has done over the last several years has not had a serious national security impact on us.' Here we have Hillary Clinton's warning coming true. Hugo Chavez is a man who has spread anti-American hatred around the globe and has formed partnerships with countries that hate the United States, like Iran and Syria. He has been deeply engaged in supporting narco-terrorists who advance his interests. He has crushed opposition at home, seeking to model the internal workings of Venezuela on the Cuban revolution. His close friendship with Fidel Castro is legendary. And he has worked closely with the Castro brothers in subverting American policy and undermining freedom and democracy across Latin America. President Obama should be working to isolate Chavez, not downplaying the dangers he poses."
"When President Obama says that Venezuela's Hugo Chavez has not had 'a serious national security impact on us,' as he did in a TV interview, he demonstrated why we need a change in the White House and why Mitt Romney will provide the leadership, the determination, the steely resolve that is needed to face the challenges of our hemisphere. The President appears to be blithely unaware of Chavez's hatred for our nation, including his efforts to promote anti-American regimes across the Western Hemisphere undermining our foreign and security policies.
"In Chavez we have a dictator who has systematically crushed democracy within his own country trying to install a totalitarian state like the one led by his close allies the Castro brothers. I would ask the President that if these actions do not constitute a threat to our national security, then what does? We can't afford four more years of a President who is blind to a major threat in our own hemisphere. While Obama fiddles, our region is set on fire by the enemies of the U.S."
"Virginia is the home of America's military. We are home to the Pentagon, to Quantico, to Norfolk, to Langley AFB, and so many other critical components of our nation's armed forces. The President has put our defense budget on course for radical cuts that even his own Secretary of Defense says will be "devastating" to U.S. national security. An American president's most fundamental duty is to protect our country. As the Governor of Virginia, but also as a veteran, the son of a veteran and the father of a veteran, I fully understand that what is at stake is not only a potentially major economic blow to the Commonwealth but a great deal more: namely, our national security in a dangerous world."
President Obama Has Claimed Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez Does Not Pose A "Serious" National Security Threat To The United States. "Oscar Haza, a well-known Miami Spanish-language broadcast journalist and anchor, scored an interview this week in Washington with President Barack Obama in which Obama said Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez has not posed a "serious" national security threat to the United States." (Patricia Mazzei, "Obama To Miami Anchor: Hugo Chávez Has Not Posed 'Serious' National Security Threat," Miami Herald, 7/10/12)
"Our men and women in uniform are the best in the world. We owe it to them to provide the resources and tools they need to do their job in defending this great nation. We must do all we can to avoid the looming massive defense cuts, and I am disappointed that President Obama has been silent on this critical issue. When it comes to national security, our strategy should determine our military needs, not political expediency and not election-year gimmicks."
"As a former Secretary of Defense, I am deeply concerned about the damage a sequester will do to our national security. We can no longer maintain our status as a world power if we try to deal with the deficit by dramatic cuts to the military, as the Obama Administration seems to be inclined to do. I solidly endorse Governor Romney's position that we need to maintain a strong national defense."
"The President signed and supported cuts in the defense budget of close to a trillion dollars that his own Secretary of Defense has said—we're talking about Leon Panetta, here—are devastating to the military and equivalent to shooting ourselves in the head. This was done with no strategic analysis of the needs of national security and no plan for how to implement the cuts. Even now we don't know the details of how the cuts are going to be implemented. We do know that they're planning to cut 200,000 troops. Given the state of the economy, it's equivalent to laying them off and the military is sending them to the unemployment lines." — Former Senator Jim Talent
"Even Barack Obama's Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, is alarmed about the course the President has set us on. In fact, he's highly alarmed, going so far as to say that it will have the same effect as 'shooting ourselves in the head.' For President Obama to play budgetary Russian roulette with national defense is shameful. The damage to our local economy here in Virginia will be enormous. But the damage to our national security is what really counts. It is absolutely critical that we seriously attack our debt and deficit problems, and that's going to take cooperation to avoid these types of severe sequestration cuts."
Unfortunately, the defense cuts you signed into law will hit Virginians hard. Your insistence on slashing our military to pay the tab for your irresponsible spending could see over 200,000 troops forced from service. It will shut the doors on factories and shipyards that support our warfighters, take a heavy toll on the guard and reserves, and potentially shutter Virginia military bases. It will shrink our Navy below a level that is already not adequate for protecting our national security. Mr. President, our troops, military families, and veterans want to know why defense is the only part of the federal budget you are willing to cut. They deserve better.
Your own Secretary of Defense has said that they will be "devastating" to our national security, the same as "shooting ourselves in the head." But when Congress presented you a way out of this mess, a mess of your own making, you threatened to veto their bill. And the reason you gave, Mr. President, is that you would not stop devastating cuts to our national security unless Congress agreed to raise our taxes.
"President Obama recently downplayed the threat to the United States posed by Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, saying that his 'overall sense is that what Mr. Chavez has done over the past several years has not had a serious national security impact on us.' The Venezuelan dictator has now returned the favor, expressing his preference for Barack Obama over Mitt Romney in the U.S. presidential election campaign.  In an interview, Chavez heaped abuse on Romney while explaining that President Obama is 'deep down a good guy.' There is little surprising here. Chavez knows that in Mitt Romney he will face an American president who will not tolerate his antics or his aggression. And he knows that in Barack Obama, he faces an American president who has not blocked his path in any way."
Any time our military accomplishes a vital mission it is a proud moment for our nation. But we owe our veterans and our military more than just an accounting of our successes. They deserve a fair and frank assessment of the whole picture — of where we are and where we want to be. And when it comes to national security and foreign policy, as with our economy, the last few years have been a time of declining influence and missed opportunity.
This isn't a partisan issue; it's a national security crisis. And yesterday, Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, quote, "I think the White House has to understand that some of this is coming from their ranks."
It is not enough to say the matter is being looked into, and leave it at that. When the issue is the political use of highly sensitive national security information, it is unacceptable to say, "We'll report our findings after Election Day."
The harm done when national security secrets are betrayed extends, of course, to the trust that allies place in the United States.
President Obama had a moment of candor, however, just the other day. He said that the actions of the Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez have not had a serious national security impact on us. In my view, inviting Hezbollah into our hemisphere is severe, serious, and a threat.
"American power abroad is rooted in our strength at home. Barack Obama has singularly failed to breathe life into the U.S. economy, and has set the U.S. military on a path toward budget cuts that his own Secretary of Defense has called 'devastating' to our national security.Mitt Romney's speech to the VFW shows that with the right leadership our country need not follow a path of decline, but instead a path of leadership. Governor Romney will restore American leadership and ensure another American Century. And Governor Romney would never tolerate a White House staff that leaks America's national-security secrets, as Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has found to be the practice under Barack Obama."
Today, Mitt Romney delivered an address on foreign policy and national security at the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention in Reno, Nevada. Below are policies included in Mitt Romney's foreign policy and national security strategy.
Mitt Romney will empower our diplomatic, assistance, and national security institutions to best secure our enduring national interests and ideals. He will:
"The Obama Administration has been leaking national security secrets like a sieve. In his speech today to the VFW, Mitt Romney has made plain what he thinks about this behavior, calling it 'contemptible' and a betrayal of our national interest. This is not a partisan issue.  Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, has also been pointing fingers of blame at the Obama White House. I agree with Governor Romney when he says that those responsible for the leaking 'must be exposed, dismissed, and punished. The time for stonewalling is over.'"
"This isn't a partisan issue; it's a national security crisis. And yesterday, Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, quote, 'I think the White House has to understand that some of this is coming from their ranks.' This conduct is contemptible. It betrays our national interest. It compromises our men and women in the field. And it demands a full and prompt investigation, with explanation and consequence. Whoever provided classified information to the media, seeking political advantage for the administration, must be exposed, dismissed, and punished. The time for stonewalling is over." —Mitt Romney
Senator Feinstein: "I Think The White House Has To Understand That Some Of This Is Coming From Their Ranks." "A prominent Democrat is giving the White House heartburn over national security leaks. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, told a World Affairs Council forum yesterday, 'I think the White House has to understand that some of this is coming from their ranks.' ... The leaks have included news that the U.S. has launched cyberattacks against Iran's nuclear program and details of an investigation into an al-Qaeda bombing plot." (USA Today, 7/24/12)
President Obama "Forcefully Disputed" Allegations That White House Officials Had Anything To Do With The Leaks Of Classified Information. "At the White House on Friday, Obama forcefully disputed charges from some Republican lawmakers that his administration had been complicit in the sensitive information being made public. 'The notion that my White House would purposely release classified national security information is offensive. It's wrong,' Obama said at a morning news conference." (The Washington Post, 6/8/12)
"Mitt Romney understands America's role as the leader of the free world. He will restore American influence and respect by bolstering our economy and ensuring that we have the strongest military in the world. Unfortunately, President Obama has abdicated his responsibility as Commander in Chief by sitting on his hands while our military faces draconian defense cuts, which will hollow out our force and leave our country increasingly vulnerable to determined enemies... Similarly troubling, the President's administration has presided over a series of reckless intelligence leaks that have compromised national security and put Americans and our allies in danger. We can't afford four more years of a president who believes America should 'lead from behind.' Mitt Romney will provide the strong leadership that this president has failed to deliver."
"Every day, we see mounting evidence of President Obama's leadership failure on foreign affairs: Hugo Chavez keeps helping Iran further its network in Latin America, Daniel Ortega is settling in to an unconstitutional third term in Nicaragua, the Castro regime enriches itself with American dollars, Assad keeps toying with the world and massacring innocent Syrians, and the Russians and Chinese keep showing us why the President's blind faith in the UN has harmed our interests.  Just yesterday, the Chair of the Senate's Intelligence Committee on which I serve chastised the Obama White House for its brazen leaks of sensitive information affecting our national security.

"Earlier this morning, Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod couldn't deny what Senator Dianne Feinstein alleged on Monday — that leaks of classified national security information are coming from the Obama White House.

"Every presidency has seen its share of leaks, but the recent disclosures may be the most dangerous in our lifetime.  Troubling disclosures of highly-classified intelligence matters have occurred far too often, including covert efforts to disrupt Iran's nuclear program.  Mitt Romney has called for a thorough, independent investigation of the White House leaking, and he's right.  An investigation outside of the Attorney General's chain of command is long overdue to ensure the facts can be taken wherever they lead, including to the highest levels of our government.  America's national security officials should never allow politics to interfere with their vital work of keeping the American people safe."
New York Congressman Peter King today made the following statement on the recent leaks of sensitive national security information:
"David Axelrod said today that no one is more committed to ferreting out national security leakers from the White House than President Obama. If that is true, then the President should join with congressional leaders in calling for a thorough and independent investigation of these security breaches. Every time sensitive national-security information leaks from the White House or any part of the government, our soldiers, intelligence operatives, and our citizens are placed in jeopardy. President Obama must take the lead in putting an end to this threat to our security. The White House's exploitation of national security secrets for political gain must cease once and for all."
"So, there's a series of things that the president has done that I think, frankly, disappoints us. And, frankly, the security leaks in my judgment are a major national security problem."  — Tom Ridge, Former Secretary Of Homeland Security
 Wyoming Senator John Barrasso today made the following statement on the recent leaks of sensitive national security information:
"Even senior Obama aides like David Axelrod are not denying that the Obama White House was responsible for leaking highly sensitive classified information, putting U.S. national security at risk and endangering the brave men and women in uniform who serve our country abroad. The buck stops with President Obama, and I urge him to initiate an immediate independent investigation into these dangerous disclosures."
"President Obama's advisers can't seem to get their stories straight on whether security leaks originated from the White House. After repeated denials, it's clear the President and his advisers aren't prepared to answer tough questions about the source of sensitive national security leaks. The time for stonewalling is over, and it's time for a full, prompt, and independent investigation." — Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
When Asked If He Could "Say Flatly That Nobody From The White House Was Involved In The National Security Leaks That Are Being Investigated," Spokesman Jay Carney Did Not Deny White House Involvement.
