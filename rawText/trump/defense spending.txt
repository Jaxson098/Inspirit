We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. Finally. [Applause] Finally. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours, members of NATO. But now we have secured, over the last couple of years, more than $100 billion of increase in defense spending from our NATO Allies. They said it couldn't be done.
One of the most important responsibilities for the Federal Government is the budget of the United States. My first budget will be submitted to the Congress next month. This budget will be a public safety and national security budget—very much based on those two—with plenty of other things, but very strong. And it will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it.

This defense spending increase will be offset and paid for by finding greater savings and efficiencies across the Federal Government. We're going to do more with less. I got involved in an airplane contract, I got involved in some other contracts, and we cut the hell out of the prices. I mean, we saved a lot of money, tremendous amount of money, beyond anything that the generals that were involved—they said they've never seen anything like this before.

We are going to rebuild the United States military, finally. (Applause.) I proposed a budget that calls for one of the largest increases in defense spending history, and we need it. We need it. Got a lot of bad actors out there, folks, right? That's time, also.

Over the last 8 years, America's average military and defense spending was double what all other NATO countries spent, combined. Not fair. As we work to get other countries to pay their fair share abroad, we will continue our rebuilding at home. We're rebuilding everything, including, by the way, our great military. We will have the finest military that we've ever had at any time in the history of our country.

So we've achieved a historic increase in defense spending, and we've created a new Office of Accountability at the VA—our veterans—to ensure our veterans get the care that they so richly deserve—our veterans.

We've achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve. We have signed new legislation to hold Federal workers accountable for the care they provide to our great, great veterans. Veterans Accountability Act—they've been trying to get that done for many, many, many years, even decades. And you understand why it was tough. But we got it done. In fact, our Secretary is with us tonight, David Shulkin. And we have some just incredible people here tonight, some of whom you've already met. But the job they're doing for the vets—having to do with choice, having to do with doctors, having to do with not having to wait on line for days and days and days and getting sicker and sicker and sicker, where you could be taken care of immediately—now you go out and you see a doctor.

We've also obtained historic increase in defense spending to prevent and deter conflict. We believe in peace through strength. We're building up our military like never before. Thousands and thousands of brave Americans have paid the ultimate price for our freedom. Now it's up to us to preserve and protect their legacy.

When I spoke to you last year, I also promised that we would build up our military, and that's exactly what we have done. I am proud to report that we have worked with Congress to achieve a dramatic increase in defense spending this year. We are committed to expanding and improving a state-of-the-art missile defense system to shoot down missiles in flight, and we're getting better and better and better at it. It's actually incredible what's taking place. And we will develop new surveillance and long-range strike capabilities to prevent our enemies from launching them in the first place.

Have you talked with the President about this development where—or this unhappy development that—drifting apart? And should not you in many ways deliver, also, on this promise of significantly increasing the defense spending?

We cannot rely, if conflicts are on our doorstep, for others to step in, and we ourselves don't have to give a contribution. And this contribution will have to increase over the next few years to come. That has something to do with military engagement, with defense spending, with combating and tackling root causes of flight, but also with the readiness to become more engaged in diplomacy.

Sen. Daines. No more CRs. No more omnibuses. These men and women are looking to us to lead. Because they're defending our country. They want certainty that we've got a budget locked down. They're grateful for the increase in defense spending. I can tell you, they're doing a great job defending our country. My favorite commander's coin is from that Missile Wing. It says, "Scaring the hell out of America's enemies since 1962." [Laughter]

Or the need for NATO allies to increase their defense spending and capability, on which we saw significant increases at yesterday's summit. This includes Afghanistan, where this week I announced a further uplift of 440 U.K. troops, an ongoing commitment to a mission that began as NATO's only use of article 5, acting in support of the U.S.

One of the most important responsibilities for the Federal Government is the budget of the United States. My first budget will be submitted to the Congress next month. This budget will be a public safety and national security budget—very much based on those two—with plenty of other things, but very strong. And it will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it.

This defense spending increase will be offset and paid for by finding greater savings and efficiencies across the Federal Government. We're going to do more with less. I got involved in an airplane contract, I got involved in some other contracts, and we cut the hell out of the prices. I mean, we saved a lot of money, tremendous amount of money, beyond anything that the generals that were involved—they said they've never seen anything like this before.

After years of endless budgets cuts that have impaired our defenses, I am calling for one of the largest defense spending increases in history. And by eliminating the sequester and the uncertainty it creates, we will make it easier for the Navy to plan for the future, and thus to control costs and get the best deals for the taxpayer, which, of course, is very important, right? Got to get a good deal. We don't make a good deal, we're not doing our job. The same boat for less money. The same ship for less money. The same airplanes for less money. That's what we're doing. That's what we're doing. Means we're going to get more of them, and we can use them.
We're also going to send Congress a budget request that will include one of the largest increases to defense spending in our history. And General/Secretary Mattis is extremely upset about that. [Laughter] And it will be fully paid for, okay? Fully paid for. And I saved a lot of money on those jets, didn't I? [Laughter] Did I do a good job? More than $725 million on them. He's very happy with me. [Laughter]

And we have just gotten started. Wait until you see what's coming, folks. We've appointed a Supreme Court Justice to replace the late, great Antonin Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. He will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We are proposing a budget that will shrink the bloated Federal bureaucracy—and I mean bloated—while protecting our national security. You see what we're doing with our military: bigger, better, stronger than ever before. You see what's happening. And you're already seeing the results. Our budget calls for one of the single largest increases in defense spending history in this country.

During our meeting, I thanked Chancellor Merkel for the German Government's commitment to increase defense spending and work toward contributing at least 2 percent of GDP. I want to thank the Chancellor for her leadership in supporting NATO and its efforts in Afghanistan. This has come at significant cost, including the lives of over 50 German soldiers, whose sacrifice we greatly honor.

So I was gratified to know that the President had aligned how important he thinks NATO is. NATO is of prime importance for us, and it was not without very good reason that we said during our summit meeting in Wales that also Germany needs to increase its expense—expenditure. We committed to this 2-percent goal until 2024. Last year we increased our defense spending by 8 percent, and we're going to work together again and again on this.

We are going to rebuild the United States military, finally. (Applause.) I proposed a budget that calls for one of the largest increases in defense spending history, and we need it. We need it. Got a lot of bad actors out there, folks, right? That's time, also.

Fair burden sharing has been my top priority since taking office. We have now turned a corner. In 2016, for the first time in many years, we saw an increase in defense spending across European allies and Canada, a real increase of 3.8 percent or $10 billion more for our defense. We are now working to keep up the momentum, including by developing national plans outlining how to make good on what we agreed in 2014. We know that we all need to contribute our fair share because we need to keep our nations safe in a more dangerous world.

Secretary General Stoltenberg. On defense spending and burden sharing, that has been my top priority. I have raised it in all my meetings, in all capitals I have visited, with Prime Ministers, Presidents, Ministers of Finance, and of course, also Defense and Foreign Ministers. And I expect, of course, all allies to make good on what they decided back in 2014. And the very strong and clear message from President Trump has been very helpful. So now we see that things are starting to move in the right direction. For the first time after many, many years of decline in defense spending, we now see an increase in defense spending across Europe and Canada. So they have started to move in the right direction; 3.8 percent real increase in defense spending across Europe and Canada is a significant step in the right direction. It's not enough. We still have a long way to go, but at least they have turned a corner—the European allies have turned a corner. Instead of reducing defense spending, they have started to increase defense spending.

Many European allies, of course, reduced—or all European allies reduced defense spending after the end of the cold war because then tensions went down. But if you are decreasing defense spending when tensions are going down, then you have to be able to increase the defense spending when tensions are going up. And now they are going up.

Secretary General Stoltenberg. The most important thing is to have a strong alliance, to stay united, and be firm and predictable in our approach to Russia. And that means that we have to invest in our collective defense. That's exactly what we are doing. Deploy more troops in the eastern part of the alliance, increase the readiness of our forces, and increase defense spending. And I welcome the very strong message from President Trump on the importance of increased defense spending. We have started to do this, so we are implementing the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the cold war, providing credible deterrence. But at the same time, we have to find ways to engage with Russia, to talk with Russia. Because Russia is not—will not go away; Russia will be our biggest neighbor, and we have to find ways to live with them and to try to avoid a new cold war, a new arms race.

Over the last 8 years, America's average military and defense spending was double what all other NATO countries spent, combined. Not fair. As we work to get other countries to pay their fair share abroad, we will continue our rebuilding at home. We're rebuilding everything, including, by the way, our great military. We will have the finest military that we've ever had at any time in the history of our country.

This week, our Republican team had its own victory under the radar. That is a very important thing for the men and women of the United States military. And it's a very important thing for the people of our country. In our new budget—and it's been a very hotly contested budget because, as you know, we have to go through a long and rigorous process—but we've ended years of painful cuts to our military and just achieved a $21 billion increase in defense spending. And we didn't do any touting like the Democrats did, by the way.

Not only did we achieve this massive and badly needed increase in defense, but we did so without having to put in place an equal increase in nondefense spending, breaking the so-called parity rule that was breaking our budget and degrading our military. And that's not happening anymore; that I can tell you with surety. So you're going to have the money we need and the equipment we need.

We have already made a historic investment in defense spending—you've been reading about it—because we believe—and you know this. What's the expression? Peace through strength. Peace through strength, right? You'll understand that when you get a little bit older. Peace through strength. And that's what we're going to have. We're going to have a lot of strength, but we're going to have a lot of peace. We will buy the planes, the ships, vehicles, and equipment you need to get your job done and to come home, safe and sound, back to your families.

President Trump, you mentioned terrorism. I'm very glad that, due to your strong leadership, NATO decided to go against terrorism. Your involvement made so many nations conscious of the fact that we have to share the burden inside NATO. And this is why Romania also decided—and if I'm right, I think this is the first country during your mandate—to step up to 2 percent of GDP for defense spending. A significant part of this defense spending is going into strategic acquisitions. And I hope, President Trump, that we find good ways together to use—to make good use of this money.

So we've achieved a historic increase in defense spending, and we've created a new Office of Accountability at the VA—our veterans—to ensure our veterans get the care that they so richly deserve—our veterans.

We've achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve. We have signed new legislation to hold Federal workers accountable for the care they provide to our great, great veterans.

It's actually incredible what's taking place. And we will develop new surveillance and long-range strike capabilities to prevent our enemies from launching them in the first place.

As Commander in Chief, I am committed to keeping the United States military the best trained, best equipped, and most technologically advanced fighting force on the planet. One of my first acts as President was to direct the rebuilding of our Armed Forces and rebuilding we are. Congress took an important step this year by heeding my call for a $20 billion increase in defense spending, and we're going to be doing even much more than that. But the service men and women who defend our Nation with their lives deserve the predictable and consistent funding that will help them win quickly and win decisively.

Bartiromo: Are you gonna remove the budget caps, in terms of defense spending?

President Trump. Thank you. Thank you. Prime Minister Solberg. We are already number two in NATO after the U.S., in terms of defense spending per capita, and we are making significant investments to further strengthen our defense. And this includes, as the President said, some big buys from American industry: P-8 maritime patrol aircraft from Boeing; 52 F-35 combat aircraft from Lockheed-Martin, our largest, single, public investment ever in Norway. But also, we are buying new submarines and investments in intelligence capabilities and army assets, and—which is important also for our job in the northern parts.

One of the most important responsibilities for the Federal Government is the budget of the United States. My first budget will be submitted to the Congress next month. This budget will be a public safety and national security budget—very much based on those two—with plenty of other things, but very strong.

But also, we are buying new submarines and investments in intelligence capabilities and army assets, and—which is important also for our job in the northern parts.

We're looking to do funding for our final fight in certain areas. As you know, we've gotten just about a hundred percent of our land back from ISIS. We have troop increases necessary to accomplish what we have to do. And we have, very importantly, a pay increase for our troops. And this will be, actually, the largest pay increase for our incredible people in over a decade. It increases total defense spending by more than $60 billion from last year and funds the addition of critically needed ships, planes, helicopters, tanks, and submarines. We have submarines being built, the likes of which there's nothing anywhere in the world like the submarines we build.
One of the most important responsibilities for the Federal Government is the budget of the United States. My first budget will be submitted to the Congress next month.

We are grateful for Poland's leadership on defense spending and burden-sharing in NATO. I want to commend Poland for meeting its NATO defense-spending obligations, and I am glad that it plans to increase spending beyond the 2 percent minimum obligation. Thank you very much for that.

The United Kingdom is also a key partner in NATO. The Prime Minister and I agree that our NATO allies must increase their defense spending. We've both been working very hard toward that end. And we are very current, and some of them are not. We can't allow that to happen. But I appreciate everything you've done in that regard.
