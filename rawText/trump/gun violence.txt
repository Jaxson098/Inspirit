Ms. Rhames. Yes. So, thank you. I'm Marilyn Rhames. I'm the founder and president of Teachers Who Pray. And I founded Teachers Who Pray because I, as a teacher, believe in the beauty of every child and the unlimited potential that resides within. However, the students that I was getting weren't set up for success, because they were so significantly behind grade level. And I taught in Chicago public schools for 14 years. And during that time, we were losing students every year to gun violence. And one year, it was like 30, 32 students getting killed.

And my condolences and my heart truly go out to not just the families that have lost children in this horrific, horrific incident that has occurred, but also to our families here in the District of Columbia that experience gun violence outside of our schools that directly impact our schools, because they are our students.

And we as parents, yes, we're trying to fight to pass legislation just like you, locally. But nationally, this campaign has grown, and it's affecting all of us, all our kids, this gun violence—gun violence. So I thank you. That's my story. And we're going to keep fighting, and we're going to keep trying to pass legislation, and we're going to keep fighting for our students at Thurgood Marshall and here in the District of Columbia and across America as well. Thank you.

But last month, we did suffer a loss. One of our ninth graders was gunned down, walking distance from the school. And so when we talk about safe passage, I think in looking at what's happening with gun violence, with our scholars and with our students, I'm saying taking a double approach, right? You have to protect kids that are in schools.

Morgan: Only 8 people were killed in American by Islamist terrorism in 2017. By comparison, domestic gun violence killed at least 30,000. There was another mass shooting in a school this week in Kentucky – the 12th this year alone. Two of the worst mass shootings in American history have happened on your watch, in Las Vegas and at the church in Texas. People will be saying you're very tough on security, you want to keep Americans safe, but if you don't do anything about gun violence at all, that seems an irrational position, for somebody who wants to keep America safe.

Vice President Michael R. Pence. Well, the category you spoke about, Mr. President—the gun violence restraining orders, they're called—California, actually, has a version of this. And I think, in your meeting with Governors earlier this week, individually and as a group, we spoke about States taking steps.

And, Mr. President, I would just add, I hope we follow the data here. Because the data is going to tell you—we've talked a lot about safe schools, a lot about mental illness—the data tells you that America has a gun violence rate that is 20 times that of every other industrialized country in the world. But we don't have a higher mental illness rate. Our schools aren't less safe. We don't spend less money on law enforcement. What's different is that we have the loosest, most lax gun laws in the nation.

So I'm all for doing everything. But we should fix the mental illness system, because it's broken. Period, stop. Not because we think that it's going to solve the gun violence that——

The best way to reduce gun violence is to put criminals with firearms behind bars. And just so you understand, because I think there is no stronger protector than me: We will always protect our Second Amendment. Always.
