Ms. Rhames. Yes. So, thank you. I'm Marilyn Rhames. I'm the founder and president of Teachers Who Pray. And I founded Teachers Who Pray because I, as a teacher, believe in the beauty of every child and the unlimited potential that resides within. However, the students that I was getting weren't set up for success, because they were so significantly behind grade level. And I taught in Chicago public schools for 14 years. And during that time, we were losing students every year to gun violence. And one year, it was like 30, 32 students getting killed.

And my condolences and my heart truly go out to not just the families that have lost children in this horrific, horrific incident that has occurred, but also to our families here in the District of Columbia that experience gun violence outside of our schools that directly impact our schools, because they are our students.

And we as parents, yes, we're trying to fight to pass legislation just like you, locally. But nationally, this campaign has grown, and it's affecting all of us, all our kids, this gun violence—gun violence. So I thank you. That's my story. And we're going to keep fighting, and we're going to keep trying to pass legislation, and we're going to keep fighting for our students at Thurgood Marshall and here in the District of Columbia and across America as well. Thank you.

But last month, we did suffer a loss. One of our ninth graders was gunned down, walking distance from the school. And so when we talk about safe passage, I think in looking at what's happening with gun violence, with our scholars and with our students, I'm saying taking a double approach, right? You have to protect kids that are in schools.

Morgan: Only 8 people were killed in American by Islamist terrorism in 2017. By comparison, domestic gun violence killed at least 30,000. There was another mass shooting in a school this week in Kentucky – the 12th this year alone. Two of the worst mass shootings in American history have happened on your watch, in Las Vegas and at the church in Texas. People will be saying you're very tough on security, you want to keep Americans safe, but if you don't do anything about gun violence at all, that seems an irrational position, for somebody who wants to keep America safe.

Vice President Michael R. Pence. Well, the category you spoke about, Mr. President—the gun violence restraining orders, they're called—California, actually, has a version of this. And I think, in your meeting with Governors earlier this week, individually and as a group, we spoke about States taking steps.

And, Mr. President, I would just add, I hope we follow the data here. Because the data is going to tell you—we've talked a lot about safe schools, a lot about mental illness—the data tells you that America has a gun violence rate that is 20 times that of every other industrialized country in the world. But we don't have a higher mental illness rate. Our schools aren't less safe. We don't spend less money on law enforcement. What's different is that we have the loosest, most lax gun laws in the nation.

So I'm all for doing everything. But we should fix the mental illness system, because it's broken. Period, stop. Not because we think that it's going to solve the gun violence that——

The best way to reduce gun violence is to put criminals with firearms behind bars. And just so you understand, because I think there is no stronger protector than me: We will always protect our Second Amendment. Always.

We have--we have two people running for the United States Senate on the Democrat Party. They love late-term abortion and they believe in gun control. [booing]
Mr. Thompson. Mr. President, you know we have been invited to the White House before. And we've sat at this table with the former administration. But this is totally different. Not once did the President go around the room and ask the sheriffs what were issues that were important to us, he or she, in our parts of the country, but rather, it was an outgoing message about gun control, about other things. You asked us what is important to us, whether it's mental health in the jails, opioid addiction. You hit on them right off the bat: the border, immigration, vetting. We appreciate that. That has not happened before. We've been here before, but we've never had a President to sit down and listen to what it is that we're facing representing our constituents and public safety across this country. And that's why we appreciate it. That's why we're here today with you.
And they don't even want to do it with a gun. They talk about gun control. They don't want to do it with a gun. They want to do it with knives. They want to cut people up into little pieces because it's more painful.

The President: I'm a very big Second Amendment person, as you know very well. But take a look at Paris, where you have very very tough gun controls, take a look at that horrible slaughter that took place at the cafes where so many people were killed. And you had these thugs come in with guns. One by one for a long time, they just killed and hundreds of people wounded to this day still in the hospitals. That was one of the worst. And you've had many of them, where there are no guns except for the bad guys. So the bad guys have the guns, and if you would have had somebody with a gun right here when they walked in so that you could have had bullets going in the other direction, you wouldn't have had hundreds of people killed... By the way, you have many of those. You look at San Bernardino, California. These guys walk in – the people that they knew – they walk in and they start one by one shooting them. They had no chance.

The President: We do have gun control laws, and this sick person – he was a sicko. I mean that's the big problem, there's sick people. If he didn't have a gun he would have had a bomb or he would have something else.

Prime Minister Turnbull. Well, the—our history with gun control and regulation is obviously very different to the United States. And you're right, there was a mass shooting in Tasmania in 1996, and my predecessor, John Howard, who's very well known here in the United States—Prime Minister for nearly 12 years. John undertook some very big reforms.

And they don't even want to do it with a gun. They talk about gun control. They don't want to do it with a gun. They want to do it with knives. They want to cut people up into little pieces because it's more painful.
Yup? Now, dishonest Washington liberal Joe Manchin has a history of abandoning West Virginia. He abandoned your gun rights, supporting Obama's radical gun control. [booing]
We have--we have two people running for the United States Senate on the Democrat Party. They love late-term abortion and they believe in gun control. [booing]
The President. Well, we're dealing with Democrats. We're dealing with Republicans. We're talking about a lot of different things having to do with, as you call it, gun control. But we are talking about a lot of different things. But at the same time, we have to protect our Second Amendment very strongly, and we will always do that.

The President. We got Bill Barr involved. He's a very--he's an expert on guns and gun control. And about a week ago, we asked Bill to get involved. And those are ideas that we're talking to Republicans, Democrats, everybody about. Some they like; some they don't like. Just a series of concepts and ideas.
Limbaugh: — there have been two debates, Sir, and in both debates, your first and the vice presidential debate, there have been two areas that have never been explored, not one question asked about. One's gun control, the Second Amendment. The other's immigration.
