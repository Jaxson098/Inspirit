Border Patrol recently reported apprehending 7,000 unlawful migrants in a single week on just one part of the Texas border, a couple of weeks ago. Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point. To confront this national security crisis, last month, I declared a national emergency. A national emergency. And when I see these people—and they're good people—some Senators, mostly—I tell you, the House has been fantastic.
To protect our national security, we also impose a 10% tariff on foreign aluminum and a 25% tariff on foreign steel. And what that's done for your aluminum and steel in this country is incredible. Now, just this month, United States Steel announced that it will invest more than $1 billion to completely transform and make new, the Monwah [sic]--you know that? You know where this is? Right, next to Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh! Does anyone know? Mon Valley Works near Pittsburgh is spending over a billion dollars, thousands of jobs, the newest, the finest equipment in the world. They're gonna make steel again in our country. [cheers and applause] They haven't been building new plants for decades. Together we're putting Pennsylvania's steel back into the spine of America. [cheers and applause]
The President. And I want to thank our new Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, for the job he's done, and he views it really as a national security threat, and you have to. What can be much more threatening than people that want to pour across our borders, and we have the worst laws, we have the weakest laws in the history of any country? You can't do anything to stop them! You have program, catch and release. You catch them and then you have to release them, and they're supposed to come back to court in the next three, four, fix, six years, and nobody shows up, and the Democrats don't wanna fix it. So we're stopping them, so we don't even have to worry about court.
We are also championing the role of women in our societies. Nations that empower women are much wealthier, safer, and much more politically stable. It is therefore vital not only to a nation's prosperity, but also is vital to its national security, to pursue women's economic development.
But I took money from here and there and here and military, because it is national security, okay? How about these people that said it was not national—when drugs are pouring in—human trafficking—women, mostly women—human trafficking—and children, but mostly women. And it's going up really fast.

To protect national security, we are fully rebuilding and, for the most part, have fully rebuilt our military. Because, as I say—and I have said tonight—my first duty as President is the defense of our Nation. As a candidate, I promised to make fundamental changes to our foreign policy after years of deadly debacles and blunders under previous administrations. It has been pretty bad out there.

The President. Thank you. It's being built. It's going up good and it's, it's a big deal, and I'll tell you what, we had to fight for every inch. We have the help of our military because it is, it's national security. Let's face it, it turned out it's national security.
On no issue have Democrat politicians more thoroughly betrayed the American people than immigration. Every Democrat running for president wants to open the floodgates to unlimited refugees from all around the world, overwhelming your communities and putting our national security at grave risk. My administration has taken bold action to reduce the influx of refugees, and we are making sure local communities like yours have a much greater say about who gets admitted into your own neighborhoods. [applause] Some of these stories are so sad. Some of the stories are so sad. When it comes to setting immigration policy, we always remember this sacred truth: our first duty and our one true allegiance is to you, the American people, before anybody else. We must care for our own citizens first. Democrat immigration policies are resulting in brutal assaults and wicked murders against innocent Americans. I don't know if you even know what's happening. It's terrible. And we've moved out thousands and thousands of MS13 thugs out of our country. [applause]
The Vice President. But this president also knows that national security starts with border security. [cheers and applause] And under his leadership we've made historic investments in border security. Apprehensions on our southern border are down by 70% and we've already started to build that wall. [cheers and applause]
So we've stood with those who serve and those who served, the heroes who've kept our nation safe. But this president knows that national security starts with border security. [cheers and applause] And under President Trump's leadership, we've made historic investments in border security. Apprehensions on our southern border are down by 70% and we've already started to build that wall on the southern border of the United States [cheers and applause]
My administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism.
He also supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from Jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. This is in the manifesto.
This political class has nothing but disdain for you and for your values. They flood your communities with criminal aliens, drugs and crime, while living behind gated compounds in communities. They oppose school choice, so important is school choice, while sending their families to the best private schools. They attack the Second Amendment, while employing armed guards for themselves. They want to get rid of your Second Amendment. It's not gonna happen with me, I tell—I promise. I don't think they'll get Ron Johnson on their side. Ron, can I have your pledge please? I will protect—Okay. We got Ron Johnson. Fellas, we have your votes. In 2016, Wisconsin voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment. And you elected an outsider as President to finally put America first. That's what you did. [applause] To defend our workers and our national security, I took the toughest ever action to confront China's rampant theft of American jobs.
But the MS13, they're killers. They're horrible people. And these people go in and they go with they call them a nest, where they be standing and just run in and start swinging and fighting. And then they always come out on top. And you know what? There aren't a lot of people that would be good at that job. We have to respect those people that protect us like this. Immigration security is national security. Remember that? And we have to have borders. A nation without borders is not a nation. We don't have a nation.
And by the way, tell our senators: end Section 230. End Section 230. Put it in. We put it in. I want it in the defense bill. Put it in because it's a national security problem. [applause] It's a big national security. So hopefully, Mitch and the senators will put it in. But it's the one chance we have to bring big tech, who are vicious and violent and untruthful, to bring big tech—it's the only thing they fear is that we're going to end Section 230. So hopefully, we will do it. It happens to be a politically very popular thing to do, by the way.
Senator Perdue has been a tremendous leader on pro-American immigration reform. Like nobody else. He voted very powerfully when I was going through hell on the wall. They would have given me anything. They gave me the money for the military. They just didn't want to give me money for the wall. So, I took it out of the military. What the hell could I—? That was rather good. It's good to be a developer every once in a while. That was the one where the judges ruled yesterday. So, they said it was fine because I called it national security. So, we took it out of the military—they didn't figure that one out. Now they do. But you know what? They don't have to be careful because it's turned out to be very popular, very successful.
Mr. Giuliani. So congratulations. And what you've been doing is keeping your promises, and this is one of your promises. One of your promises was to shore up our country because one of the dangers we face—national security and crime—is cybersecurity. And a large part of our country, unlike other countries, is made up of the private sector. And the private sector is wide open to hacking. And sometimes, by hacking the private sector, you can get into Government.

So here, you're addressing not only a national security problem, but you're addressing the fastest growing form of crime in America, which is cyber theft. It's growing faster than any other crime.

And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Times's story yesterday. And it talked about—you saw it, front page. So Director of National Intelligence just put out—Acting—a statement: "Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community"—this was just given to us—"is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true."
At the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security. Foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country. And by the way, take a look at what's happening in Europe, folks. Take a look at what's happening in Europe. I took a lot of heat on Sweden. [Laughter] And then, a day later, I said, has anybody reported what's going on?

One of the most important responsibilities for the Federal Government is the budget of the United States. My first budget will be submitted to the Congress next month. This budget will be a public safety and national security budget—very much based on those two—with plenty of other things, but very strong. And it will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it.

Let's also remember that immigration security is national security. We've seen the attacks from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino. Hundreds of individuals from other countries have been charged with terrorism-related offenses in the United States.

Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. Mr. President, thank you for the honor to serve the country. It's a great privilege you've given me. Clearly, we are engaged with our allies to ensure that they know where our common interests lie, what our expectations are: that America will continue to be a leader, but they must do more. And they must meet their obligations both from a national security standpoint, but also for creating conditions of stability and prosperity.

Director of Central Intelligence Michael R. Pompeo. Mr. President, it's an honor to serve as your CIA Director. It's an incredible privilege to lead the men and women who are providing intelligence so that we can do the national security mission. And in the finest traditions at CIA, I'm not going to say a damn thing in front of the media. [Laughter]

Immigration security is also a matter—remember this—of national security. That's why we're implementing tough new vetting and screening protocols to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. You look at what just happened in Spain and so many other places. Nope. We're really vetting. We're tough. Does anybody want me to be soft on the vetting, or would you like me——

We also understand that immigration security is a national—it's really a national treasure, but it's a national security. We need national security for safety. We're going to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Sorry. Sorry. Call up some of the other countries in the world, say, "How you doing, folks?" Not so good.
We'll be giving the Cabinet, today, an update on national security and strategy. We'll also receive briefings on the latest developments in the tax cut negotiations. And Administrator McMahon, who's done a fantastic job at Small Business Administration—where's Linda? Linda did a really fantastic job—is helping small businesses in record numbers. And they've needed help, really, because of the hurricanes. The hurricanes were devastating.

Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress not only oppose our efforts to stop illegal immigration and crack down on sanctuary cities, now they are demanding amnesty as a condition for funding the Government, holding troop funding hostage and putting our national security at risk. We cannot allow it.

We've created almost 3 million new jobs since the election. And unemployment claims are at the lowest level in 49 years. Think of that. Unemployment at the lowest level in 49 years. That's a beautiful statistic. We're also taking action to protect American industries that are vital to our national security, including American aluminum and steel. You'll be hearing about that at length at 3:30. Aluminum and steel are the backbone of our Nation. They're the bedrock of our defense industrial base.

Among the many grave national security blunders of the previous administration, one of the world's worst was the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, a deal that would allow Iran to go right to the brink of nuclear weapons and ultimately very quickly have a nuclear weapon.
As we discuss another critical element of our national security to me, probably one of the reasons we're all here in this great victory celebration, is border security. We have many things to do, but we have already begun the construction of the wall and so many other things are following. We will have those borders extremely strong, extremely powerful, and we will have laws that match the border. [applause] 
Mac, you've been very involved in this issue. Do you have anything to say? Representative William M. "Mac" Thornberry. Well, Mr. President, there are a number of issues that we're going to be able to discuss today that touch on our country's national security. And certainly, controlling who and what comes across our border is an element of national security, as we do the compassionate thing with families.

Vice President Michael R. Pence. Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. And I just—I know I speak for the President when I express the gratitude of this administration for the support of the Members of the Senate and the House that are gathered around here. You've delivered for the American people on national security and rebuilding our military; on tax cuts and regulatory reform, restoring our economy.

Heidi was also against us from the very beginning of the travel ban, a common-sense policy to improve our vetting and our national security. And I'm proud to report that, just yesterday, the Supreme Court upheld the travel ban. . . and our authority to keep America safe. [applause]
We also recognize the vital importance of border security and immigration control. In order to prevent foreign acts of terrorism within our shores, we must prevent terrorists and their supporters from gaining admission in the first place. Border security is a national security problem. And in the United States, we are working very hard to get the Democrats to give us a couple of votes so we can pass meaningful and powerful border security.

Today, both Russia and the United States face a whole new set of challenges. Those include a dangerous maladjustment of mechanisms for maintaining international security and stability, regional crises, the creeping threats of terrorism and transnational crime. It's the snowballing problems in the economy, environmental risks, and other sets of challenges. We can only cope with these challenges if we join the ranks and work together. Hopefully, we will reach this understanding with our American partners.
As major nuclear powers, we bear special responsibility for maintaining international security. And it made it vital—and we mentioned this during the negotiations—it's crucial that we fine-tune the dialogue on strategic stability and global security and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We submitted our American colleagues a note with a number of specific suggestions.
We also agreed that representatives from our national security councils will meet to follow up on all of the issues we addressed today and to continue the progress we have started right here in Helsinki.
Over the last two decades, nearly two-thirds of American raw steel companies went out of business. More than one-third of the steel jobs vanished. We need steel mills for national security. Remember that. This isn't just price. This isn't just, "Gee, we could do it for a little bit less." We need it for national security. Our steel towns became ghost towns. More than 70,000 hard-working Americans lost their jobs, their hope, and their way of life. You people know it better than anybody.

Four months ago, I stood alongside steel workers just like you, and I announced that to defend our national security, we were placing a 10-percent tariff on foreign aluminum and a 25-percent tariff on foreign steel. That very same week, U.S. Steel announced it was restarting production right here in Granite City and bringing back far more than the original estimate of 500 jobs. A lot more than that now. And just last month, U.S. Steel announced the reopening of the second blast furnace, far ahead of schedule, meaning almost 1,000 jobs. And those are good-paying jobs.

And these tactics—so they're not working, because we're not going to give China or any other country a veto on United States national security. We're not going to do it. And we will not let anybody bully our wonderful American farmers. Our fortunes as a nation rise and fall together, and that is why we are going to stick together and win for our farmers and our factory workers, our steelworkers—here we are—all across this Nation.

Mr. Giuliani. So congratulations. And what you've been doing is keeping your promises, and this is one of your promises. One of your promises was to shore up our country because one of the dangers we face—national security and crime—is cybersecurity. And a large part of our country, unlike other countries, is made up of the private sector. And the private sector is wide open to hacking. And sometimes, by hacking the private sector, you can get into Government.

So here, you're addressing not only a national security problem, but you're addressing the fastest growing form of crime in America, which is cyber theft. It's growing faster than any other crime.

Prime Minister, I pledge to work with you in pursuit of our many shared interests. This includes a stronger trading relationship between the United States and Canada. It includes safe, efficient, and responsible cross-border travel and migration. And it includes close partnership on domestic and international security.

And, Prime Minister Trudeau, you've made very clear that Canada has an open-door policy for Syrian refugees. Do you believe that President Trump's moratorium on immigration has merit on national security grounds?

And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Times's story yesterday. And it talked about—you saw it, front page. So Director of National Intelligence just put out—Acting—a statement: "Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community"—this was just given to us—"is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true."
At the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security. Foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country. And by the way, take a look at what's happening in Europe, folks. Take a look at what's happening in Europe. I took a lot of heat on Sweden.

One of the most important responsibilities for the Federal Government is the budget of the United States. My first budget will be submitted to the Congress next month. This budget will be a public safety and national security budget—very much based on those two—with plenty of other things, but very strong. And it will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it.

And we have just gotten started. Wait until you see what's coming, folks. We've appointed a Supreme Court Justice to replace the late, great Antonin Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. He will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We are proposing a budget that will shrink the bloated Federal bureaucracy—and I mean bloated—while protecting our national security. You see what we're doing with our military: bigger, better, stronger than ever before. You see what's happening. And you're already seeing the results. Our budget calls for one of the single largest increases in defense spending history in this country.

We also recognize that immigration security is national security. We must protect our citizens from those who seek to spread terrorism, extremism, and violence inside our borders. Immigration is a privilege, not a right, and the safety of our citizens must always come first, without question.

Today I'm directing the Department of Commerce to immediately prioritize the investigation it began yesterday and really long before that—because Wilbur and I have been working on this for a long time—into foreign steel arriving into our markets and to submit a report on the effects of these foreign steel products on the national security of the United States. It's not just the pricing, it's not just employment, it also has to do with the national security of our country, which people never talk about. I talk about it.
Maintaining the production of American steel is extremely important to our national security and our defense industrial base. Steel is critical to both our economy and our military. This is not an area where we can afford to become dependent on foreign countries. We have a product where we actually need foreign countries to be nice to us in order to fight for our people. And that's not going to happen any longer, believe me, especially as it comes to steel.
This investigation will look at how steel imports are impacting United States national security, taking into account foreign practices such as steel dumping. Dumping is a tremendous problem in this country. They're dumping vast amounts of steel in our company—in our country, and they're really hurting not only our country, but our companies. Their targeting of American industry and other foreign strategies designed to undermine American industry as a whole. Based on the findings of this report, Secretary Wilbur Ross will make formal recommendations to the White House in a very, very, near future. He'll be back very soon with those recommendations that we will implement.
Let's also remember that immigration security is national security. We've seen the attacks from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino. Hundreds of individuals from other countries have been charged with terrorism-related offenses in the United States.

The Prime Minister and I just finished a productive discussion about the interests of our two countries. Together we discussed crucial issues ranging from national security to trade, to immigration and enhanced economic cooperation. We reaffirmed the tremendous friendship between the United States and Australia and the vital importance of our security and our alliance.

To secure our borders from drug cartels, human smugglers, and terrorist threats, Coast Guard Cutters patrol more than 1,500 miles below our southern border. A lot of people didn't know that. When enormous pride hits your heart, you realize that it's with this great skill and tremendous speed, our Coast Guard men and women interdict dangerous criminals and billions and billions of dollars' worth of illegal narcotics every single year. Your helicopters launch from the decks of world-class national security cutters, and they chase drug smugglers at speeds far in excess of 50 knots.

On Thursday, I am glad to report, these two bills passed the House of Representatives. This represents a crucial step toward ensuring our public safety and national security. I want to thank Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte for his dedicated work on these critical bills, as well as other crucial legislation that will soon be considered as well. I also thank leadership for advancing these lifesaving measures.

That is why, shortly after my Inauguration, I directed Secretary of Defense Mattis and my national security team to undertake a comprehensive review of all strategic options in Afghanistan and South Asia. My original instinct was to pull out, and historically, I like following my instincts. But all my life, I've heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office, in other words, when you're President of the United States. So I studied Afghanistan in great detail and from every conceivable angle. After many meetings, over many months, we held our final meeting last Friday at Camp David, with my Cabinet and generals, to complete our strategy. I arrived at three fundamental conclusion about America's core interests in Afghanistan.

Immigration security is also a matter—remember this—of national security. That's why we're implementing tough new vetting and screening protocols to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. You look at what just happened in Spain and so many other places. Nope. We're really vetting. We're tough. Does anybody want me to be soft on the vetting, or would you like me——

We also understand that immigration security is a national—it's really a national treasure, but it's a national security. We need national security for safety. We're going to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Sorry. Sorry. Call up some of the other countries in the world, say, "How you doing, folks?" Not so good.
We've also taken historic action to protect our manufacturing and defense industrial base. My administration has ordered a first-ever complete review of the manufacturing technology and supply chains we need to protect our country. We cannot have national security without economic security.

We have a close partnership, too, on security cooperation, including transnational security, terrorism, and cybersecurity. Singapore has lent early and consistent support to the defeat-ISIS coalition. We were one of the first countries to participate and are still the only Asian country to have contributed both military assets and personnel. And as I told President Trump when we met, Singapore will extend our existing deployment to the operation into 2018 for an additional year.

Upon my Inauguration, I pledged that we would rebuild America, restore its economic strength, and defend its national security. With this goal in mind, I vowed that we would reaffirm old alliances and form new friendships in pursuit of shared goals. Above all, I swore that in every decision, with every action, I would put the best interests of the American people first. Over the past 10 months, traveling across the globe and meeting with world leaders, that is exactly what I have done.

The second pillar of our strategy is to promote American prosperity. For the first time, American strategy recognizes that economic security is national security. Economic vitality, growth, and prosperity at home is absolutely necessary for American power and influence abroad. Any nation that trades away its prosperity for security will end up losing both. That is why this National Security Strategy emphasizes, more than ever before, the critical steps we must take to ensure the prosperity of our Nation for a long, long time to come. It calls for cutting taxes and rolling back unnecessary regulations. It calls for trade based on the principles of fairness and reciprocity. It calls for firm action against unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. And it calls for new steps to protect our national security industrial and innovation base.

It calls for a total modernization of our military and reversing previous decisions to shrink our Armed Forces, even as threats to national security grew. It calls for streamlining acquisition, eliminating bloated bureaucracy, and massively building up our military, which has the fundamental side benefit of creating millions and millions of jobs.

Senator Daniel S. Sullivan. Well, Mr. President, I want to thank you and your administration. I want to thank Secretary Zinke, who's doing a great job. But Senator Murkowski said it very well, this administration has come in and recognized this incredible, incredible resource that we have in our Nation. Developing our energy is good for jobs, it's good for energy security, it's good for manufacturing, it's good for the environment, because we have the highest standards in the world, and it's very, very good for our foreign policy and national security.

Mr. President, sir, you released your national security strategy just a couple days ago. And in there, you talk about the economy—which is what this tax bill is all about—but you also talk about energy dominance. And I want to thank you. I want to thank you on behalf of all Alaskans and the American people, because it's the right policy. And we're finally, finally doing it.

Last year, I directed the Secretary of Commerce to investigate whether steel and aluminum imports are threatening to impair U.S. national security. You see what's happened with our steel and aluminum industries. They're being decimated by dumping and—from many countries, in particular one, but many countries. They're dumping and destroying our industry and destroying the families of workers. And we can't let that happen.

Vice President Michael R. Pence. Well, thank you, Mr. President. I just want to thank all of the Republican and Democrats taking time to be here and their profound issue—profound interest in this issue. To your point, this is about our economy, but it's about national security. And the President directed a 232 review to determine whether or not our national security has been affected by the dumping of steel and aluminum.

And today it is very much the President's desire, our administration's desire, to hear from each of you and the perspectives that will also inform the decisions that the President will make. I think that it is fair to say that we all support national security. I think that's evidenced by the recent budget agreement that the President helped drive, and Republicans and Democrats have supported, for a historic increase in our national defense.

Sen. Toomey. When that's happening. But the 232 is a different matter, and invoking national security, when I think it's really hard to make that case, invites retaliation that will be problematic for us.

And so, even though there may be some job winners from an action like this, I strongly suspect that, as has at times been the case in the past, you would end up with net job losses in the United States. And that's what worries me here, particularly in light of the absence of what I can see as a real national security threat. Only 3 percent of what we're able to produce domestically is what's needed for our national security reasons, and I think that ought to be taken into account.

Sen. Casey. I just want to make a point about—back to 232. I'll focus on steel 232 in Pennsylvania. In your opening, you talked about the job impact, as well as the national security impact, and I'm glad you raised both. I'll just focus on national security.

Sen. Casey. To the extent that you can focus on that, I think the steel executives—the letter they sent you on the 1st of February, I think, outlines the problem. But this really is a national security issue.

Sen. Portman. And that's hurting our ability to continue to have this energy independence we talked about. So those are two specific areas where I do think that there's an opportunity to do something and to use 232, which is a national security, as opposed to 201, which is what President Bush used.

The President. Go ahead, Rick. Representative Erick A. "Rick" Crawford. Thank you, Mr. President. One thing I want to point out, we had the conversation about the national security imperative, and I think we've looked at it in the context of the defense industry.

And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Times's story yesterday. And it talked about—you saw it, front page. So Director of National Intelligence just put out—Acting—a statement: "Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community"—this was just given to us—"is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true."
One of the most important responsibilities for the Federal Government is the budget of the United States. My first budget will be submitted to the Congress next month. This budget will be a public safety and national security budget—very much based on those two—with plenty of other things, but very strong. And it will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it.

Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. Mr. President, thank you for the honor to serve the country. It's a great privilege you've given me. Clearly, we are engaged with our allies to ensure that they know where our common interests lie, what our expectations are: that America will continue to be a leader, but they must do more. And they must meet their obligations both from a national security standpoint, but also for creating conditions of stability and prosperity.

Director of Central Intelligence Michael R. Pompeo. Mr. President, it's an honor to serve as your CIA Director. It's an incredible privilege to lead the men and women who are providing intelligence so that we can do the national security mission. And in the finest traditions at CIA, I'm not going to say a damn thing in front of the media. [Laughter]

This program grants visas not on a basis of merit, but simply because applicants are randomly selected in an annual lottery. And the people put in that lottery are not that country's finest. We know that the program presents significant vulnerabilities to our national security. It's a very unsafe program for our country, and we're not going to allow it to happen, and end that program. So I think Congress will take that up very quickly.
So, in a few days, I'll be traveling to Asia to advance America's economic and national security priorities. I will miss you folks. [Laughter] I will miss everyone at this table. [Laughter]
Among the many grave national security blunders of the previous administration, one of the world's worst was the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, a deal that would allow Iran to go right to the brink of nuclear weapons and ultimately very quickly have a nuclear weapon.
As we discuss another critical element of our national security to me, probably one of the reasons we're all here in this great victory celebration, is border security. We have many things to do, but we have already begun the construction of the wall and so many other things are following. We will have those borders extremely strong, extremely powerful, and we will have laws that match the border. [applause] 
And just to finish up, national security, we had $700 billion approved for our military. We had $716 billion approved for next year, for our military. We needed that. I hated the last budget, except I loved what happened to our military. And sometimes, you'll take a little bit of a hit in order to take care of military. Without the military, we're not here. We have the most powerful military that we've ever had—very shortly, on line. We're ordering planes, we're ordering ships, we're ordering a lot of different things. The finest equipment in the world. We make the best equipment.

So the—it's very important to have these mines take place and help revitalize Northeastern Minnesota. And on top of that, it has national security implications. You know? It—really, national security, not just—we don't want to rely on our enemies. But we need to rebuild our infrastructure. And what a great resource to build with our own homegrown materials, homemade materials, and rebuild the infrastructure of America. The President. That's right. Thank you very much.

Heidi was also against us from the very beginning of the travel ban, a common-sense policy to improve our vetting and our national security. And I'm proud to report that, just yesterday, the Supreme Court upheld the travel ban. . . and our authority to keep America safe. [applause]
But for the sake of our national security, the New York Times should publish his name at once. I think their reporters should go and investigate who it is. That would actually be a good scoop. [applause]
Another critical element of national security is energy security. And, Rick Perry, you're doing a great job. I'm proud of you. Very proud of you. He was the Governor of Texas for 12 years. He was not only a great Governor, he was a great cheerleader. And he ran for President—he was nasty against me, wasn't he, though? Wow. [Laughter] He was tough. And you're doing great, Rick. We appreciate it very much.

Republicans know that the rule of law is essential to national sovereignty. And we know that immigration enforcement is essential to public safety, national security, and the protection of American jobs, wages, and public benefits. You know that.
And earlier this year, I kept a very crucial promise. To protect our national security, I imposed a 10 percent tariff on foreign aluminum and a 25 percent tariff on foreign steel. And now our steel, aluminum industries are roaring back to life, like nothing you've ever seen. [applause]
Morgan: Let's turn to security, national security. You've been very tough on this. You vowed again, in an interview with Good Morning Britain, you were going to hammer ISIS hard. ISIS is now out of Iraq and Syria. I mean, that's a big double success for you, right?

So, at this moment, it looks much more like we're not going to do business. I don't want to do business at all, because it is a national security threat. And I really believe that the media has covered it a little bit differently than that. So we're looking, really, not to do business with Huawei. And we're actually talking about not doing any business, because, again, the rest of it is not national security, but it's very difficult to determine what's coming in and what's not coming in. It's still Huawei. So we'll be making a decision over that in the not-too-distant future. But it's a little bit the opposite of what seemed to be reported this morning.

Unrelated to that, I believe that the concept also of voter identification has to be looked at, because you can't have great security for the voter. People that vote, you can't have that national security unless you're going to have voter identification. It's something people have to look at very strongly.

The President. Well, I'm talking to my people, but ultimately, we don't want to do business with Huawei for national security reasons.

And we have just gotten started. Wait until you see what's coming, folks. We've appointed a Supreme Court Justice to replace the late, great Antonin Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. He will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We are proposing a budget that will shrink the bloated Federal bureaucracy—and I mean bloated—while protecting our national security. You see what we're doing with our military: bigger, better, stronger than ever before. You see what's happening. And you're already seeing the results. Our budget calls for one of the single largest increases in defense spending history in this country.

All I know is I want to put my miners back to work. And I know it works. And I know--and I know for national security reasons--another reason--coal is something we have to have. We have to have. But they said it's the finest coal in the world. I thought that was great. Might as well tell you. Now I've told you, and I don't feel guilty any longer. But I just want to introduce your next United States Senator from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey. Patrick, come on up. [applause]
To protect our national security, we also impose a 10% tariff on foreign aluminum and a 25% tariff on foreign steel. And what that's done for your aluminum and steel in this country is incredible. Now, just this month, United States Steel announced that it will invest more than $1 billion to completely transform and make new, the Monwah [sic]--you know that? You know where this is? Right, next to Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh! Does anyone know? Mon Valley Works near Pittsburgh is spending over a billion dollars, thousands of jobs, the newest, the finest equipment in the world. They're gonna make steel again in our country. [cheers and applause] They haven't been building new plants for decades. Together we're putting Pennsylvania's steel back into the spine of America. [cheers and applause]
The President. And I want to thank our new Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, for the job he's done, and he views it really as a national security threat, and you have to. What can be much more threatening than people that want to pour across our borders, and we have the worst laws, we have the weakest laws in the history of any country? You can't do anything to stop them! You have program, catch and release. You catch them and then you have to release them, and they're supposed to come back to court in the next three, four, fix, six years, and nobody shows up, and the Democrats don't wanna fix it. So we're stopping them, so we don't even have to worry about court.
I also want to highlight that the behavior of the dictatorship is also affecting the national security of many states, obviously including Colombia. Nicolás Maduro has become a sponsor, and he's providing safe haven to terrorist groups from Colombia to plot against the Colombian people. And that attitude is only comparable to what the world saw when the Taliban regime allowed Al Qaida to plot against the whole world in their soil.

The President. Thank you. It's being built. It's going up good and it's, it's a big deal, and I'll tell you what, we had to fight for every inch. We have the help of our military because it is, it's national security. Let's face it, it turned out it's national security.
On no issue have Democrat politicians more thoroughly betrayed the American people than immigration. Every Democrat running for president wants to open the floodgates to unlimited refugees from all around the world, overwhelming your communities and putting our national security at grave risk. My administration has taken bold action to reduce the influx of refugees, and we are making sure local communities like yours have a much greater say about who gets admitted into your own neighborhoods. [applause] Some of these stories are so sad. Some of the stories are so sad. When it comes to setting immigration policy, we always remember this sacred truth: our first duty and our one true allegiance is to you, the American people, before anybody else. We must care for our own citizens first. Democrat immigration policies are resulting in brutal assaults and wicked murders against innocent Americans. I don't know if you even know what's happening. It's terrible. And we've moved out thousands and thousands of MS13 thugs out of our country. [applause]
The Vice President. But this president also knows that national security starts with border security. [cheers and applause] And under his leadership we've made historic investments in border security. Apprehensions on our southern border are down by 70% and we've already started to build that wall. [cheers and applause]
So we've stood with those who serve and those who served, the heroes who've kept our nation safe. But this president knows that national security starts with border security. [cheers and applause] And under President Trump's leadership, we've made historic investments in border security. Apprehensions on our southern border are down by 70% and we've already started to build that wall on the southern border of the United States [cheers and applause]
In normal times, these massive flows place a vast burden on our health care system, but during a global pandemic, they threaten to create a perfect storm that would spread the infection to our border agents, migrants, and to the public at large. Left unchecked, this would cripple our immigration system, overwhelm our health care system, and severely damage our national security. We're not going to let that happen. So we have a lot of information, and they'll be discussing that in a moment.

Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo. Thank you, Mr. President. Before I address the efforts that we've been engaged in to push back against the Chinese virus, I want to assure the American people that, as President Trump just said, your State Department, your entire national security team is staying focused on the other diplomatic challenges around the world. Those include reducing risk to America from Afghanistan, holding the Iranian regime accountable for its malign activity. And our counterterrorism efforts against ISIS remain a priority for our team.

Our adversaries should take note, however: This President has a clear-eyed focus on America's national security's—security interest. And let me be clear, it would be a mistake—a mistake with terrible consequences—for any adversary to attempt to do us harm during this health crisis or ever, for that matter.

Former Lt. Gov. Sanchez. And they appreciate national security and public safety.

Under my administration, we've dramatically reduced refugee resettlement and we've suspended refugee resettlement during the pandemic, you know that we've totally suspended it, nobody comes in. Lucky, we have the wall, we're up to 300 miles almost. If we didn't have that wall, we would be inundated with people and you know unfortunately, and we're helping them, we sent them a lot of ventilators and other equipment, but Mexico is being overrun with the pandemic and we would really have a problem. We've completely reformed refugee policy. We've instituted rigorous national security checks. We protected religious minorities, and we've shifted refugee admissions away from terror afflicted nations, like Syria, and Somalia. [applause]
The historic achievements that I've discussed today are only a slim fraction of the extraordinary accomplishment that we've all done together in the last four years. Here's just a short list of our landmarks. Really, they are landmarks, true landmarks. We instituted a national security travel ban on the world's most dangerous regions, including jihadist regions, keeping terrorists and extremists out of our country. Everyone said, "Oh, that's so bad." Remember when they said, "Oh, that's so bad." I don't think it's so bad at all. We won the travel ban. The fake news said we didn't because we lost in the lower court, we lost in the second court, and we won in the Supreme court. So, they said we lost. Can you believe it?
He also supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from Jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. This is in the manifesto.
He's also pledged to terminate all national security travel bans, overwhelming your state with poorly vetted migrants from jihadist regions. Making matters worse, he would open the flood gates in the middle of a pandemic. And by the way, the wall, it's over 311 miles long right now, doing very well. [cheers and applause] Doing very well. Make the mic louder, the mic louder.
John Bolton, who was your national security advisor, said you are a danger to the country.

The President. Okay, they're giving me studies on the deal. It has to be a hundred percent as far as national security is concerned. And no, I'm not prepared to sign off on anything. I have to see the deal.

WELKER: All right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.
BIDEN: I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay the price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I'm elected. Interfering with American sovereignty. That's what's going on right now. They're interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President said anything to Putin about it. I don't think he's talking a lot. I don't think he said a word. I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it. And I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he'd probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won't, I shouldn't — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He's being used as a Russian pawn. He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me. I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question. Why isn't that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty.
Biden has pledged a staggering 700 percent increase in refugees from the most dangerous and violent terrorist hot spots on earth. He has also vowed to terminate our national security travel bans, allowing for unlimited migration from war zones, and terrorist havens. Biden's deadly migration policies will overwhelm taxpayers and open the floodgates to terrorists, jihadists, and violent extremists. Under my Administration, the safety of our families will always come FIRST."
And by the way, tell our senators: end Section 230. End Section 230. Put it in. We put it in. I want it in the defense bill. Put it in because it's a national security problem. [applause] It's a big national security. So hopefully, Mitch and the senators will put it in. But it's the one chance we have to bring big tech, who are vicious and violent and untruthful, to bring big tech—it's the only thing they fear is that we're going to end Section 230. So hopefully, we will do it. It happens to be a politically very popular thing to do, by the way.
Senator Perdue has been a tremendous leader on pro-American immigration reform. Like nobody else. He voted very powerfully when I was going through hell on the wall. They would have given me anything. They gave me the money for the military. They just didn't want to give me money for the wall. So, I took it out of the military. What the hell could I—? That was rather good. It's good to be a developer every once in a while. That was the one where the judges ruled yesterday. So, they said it was fine because I called it national security. So, we took it out of the military—they didn't figure that one out. Now they do. But you know what? They don't have to be careful because it's turned out to be very popular, very successful.
Prime Minister, I pledge to work with you in pursuit of our many shared interests. This includes a stronger trading relationship between the United States and Canada. It includes safe, efficient, and responsible cross-border travel and migration. And it includes close partnership on domestic and international security.

And, Prime Minister Trudeau, you've made very clear that Canada has an open-door policy for Syrian refugees. Do you believe that President Trump's moratorium on immigration has merit on national security grounds?

And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Times's story yesterday. And it talked about—you saw it, front page. So Director of National Intelligence just put out—Acting—a statement: "Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community"—this was just given to us—"is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true."
At the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security. Foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country. And by the way, take a look at what's happening in Europe, folks. Take a look at what's happening in Europe. I took a lot of heat on Sweden. [Laughter] And then, a day later, I said, has anybody reported what's going on?

And we have just gotten started. Wait until you see what's coming, folks. We've appointed a Supreme Court Justice to replace the late, great Antonin Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. He will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We are proposing a budget that will shrink the bloated Federal bureaucracy—and I mean bloated—while protecting our national security. You see what we're doing with our military: bigger, better, stronger than ever before. You see what's happening. And you're already seeing the results. Our budget calls for one of the single largest increases in defense spending history in this country.

We also recognize that immigration security is national security. We must protect our citizens from those who seek to spread terrorism, extremism, and violence inside our borders. Immigration is a privilege, not a right, and the safety of our citizens must always come first, without question.

Let's also remember that immigration security is national security. We've seen the attacks from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino. Hundreds of individuals from other countries have been charged with terrorism-related offenses in the United States.

The Prime Minister and I just finished a productive discussion about the interests of our two countries. Together we discussed crucial issues ranging from national security to trade, to immigration and enhanced economic cooperation. We reaffirmed the tremendous friendship between the United States and Australia and the vital importance of our security and our alliance.

You have promised to put America First in all that you do, and you've done that in any number of ways, from trade, to national security, to protecting our border, to rightsizing Washington, DC. And today you've put America first with regard to international agreements and the environment.
Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. Mr. President, thank you for the honor to serve the country. It's a great privilege you've given me. Clearly, we are engaged with our allies to ensure that they know where our common interests lie, what our expectations are: that America will continue to be a leader, but they must do more. And they must meet their obligations both from a national security standpoint, but also for creating conditions of stability and prosperity.

Director of Central Intelligence Michael R. Pompeo. Mr. President, it's an honor to serve as your CIA Director. It's an incredible privilege to lead the men and women who are providing intelligence so that we can do the national security mission. And in the finest traditions at CIA, I'm not going to say a damn thing in front of the media. [Laughter]

Thank you very much for being here to discuss two crucial votes taking place in Congress tomorrow on vital safety and national security legislation.

On Thursday, I am glad to report, these two bills passed the House of Representatives. This represents a crucial step toward ensuring our public safety and national security. I want to thank Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte for his dedicated work on these critical bills, as well as other crucial legislation that will soon be considered as well. I also thank leadership for advancing these lifesaving measures.

Immigration security is also a matter—remember this—of national security. That's why we're implementing tough new vetting and screening protocols to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. You look at what just happened in Spain and so many other places. Nope. We're really vetting. We're tough. Does anybody want me to be soft on the vetting, or would you like me——

We also understand that immigration security is a national—it's really a national treasure, but it's a national security. We need national security for safety. We're going to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Sorry. Sorry. Call up some of the other countries in the world, say, "How you doing, folks?" Not so good.
This program grants visas not on a basis of merit, but simply because applicants are randomly selected in an annual lottery. And the people put in that lottery are not that country's finest. We know that the program presents significant vulnerabilities to our national security. It's a very unsafe program for our country, and we're not going to allow it to happen, and end that program. So I think Congress will take that up very quickly.
So, in a few days, I'll be traveling to Asia to advance America's economic and national security priorities. I will miss you folks. [Laughter] I will miss everyone at this table. [Laughter]
Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress not only oppose our efforts to stop illegal immigration and crack down on sanctuary cities, now they are demanding amnesty as a condition for funding the Government, holding troop funding hostage and putting our national security at risk. We cannot allow it.

I'd also like to take a moment today to discuss our immigration system and how we can reform it to make it work for everyday Americans. Our current immigration system helps special interests, but hurts American workers, taxpayers, and national security.

Because these individuals are admitted solely on the basis of family ties—not skill or not merit—most of this immigration is lower skilled, putting great strain on Federal welfare. And because there is no real selection criteria, the current system is totally incompatible with national security.

The second pillar of our strategy is to promote American prosperity. For the first time, American strategy recognizes that economic security is national security. Economic vitality, growth, and prosperity at home is absolutely necessary for American power and influence abroad. Any nation that trades away its prosperity for security will end up losing both. That is why this National Security Strategy emphasizes, more than ever before, the critical steps we must take to ensure the prosperity of our Nation for a long, long time to come. It calls for cutting taxes and rolling back unnecessary regulations. It calls for trade based on the principles of fairness and reciprocity. It calls for firm action against unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. And it calls for new steps to protect our national security industrial and innovation base.

It calls for a total modernization of our military and reversing previous decisions to shrink our Armed Forces, even as threats to national security grew. It calls for streamlining acquisition, eliminating bloated bureaucracy, and massively building up our military, which has the fundamental side benefit of creating millions and millions of jobs.

Morgan: Let's turn to security, national security. You've been very tough on this. You vowed again, in an interview with Good Morning Britain, you were going to hammer ISIS hard. ISIS is now out of Iraq and Syria. I mean, that's a big double success for you, right?

Last year, I directed the Secretary of Commerce to investigate whether steel and aluminum imports are threatening to impair U.S. national security. You see what's happened with our steel and aluminum industries. They're being decimated by dumping and—from many countries, in particular one, but many countries. They're dumping and destroying our industry and destroying the families of workers. And we can't let that happen.

Vice President Michael R. Pence. Well, thank you, Mr. President. I just want to thank all of the Republican and Democrats taking time to be here and their profound issue—profound interest in this issue. To your point, this is about our economy, but it's about national security. And the President directed a 232 review to determine whether or not our national security has been affected by the dumping of steel and aluminum.

And today it is very much the President's desire, our administration's desire, to hear from each of you and the perspectives that will also inform the decisions that the President will make. I think that it is fair to say that we all support national security. I think that's evidenced by the recent budget agreement that the President helped drive, and Republicans and Democrats have supported, for a historic increase in our national defense.

Sen. Toomey. When that's happening. But the 232 is a different matter, and invoking national security, when I think it's really hard to make that case, invites retaliation that will be problematic for us.

And so, even though there may be some job winners from an action like this, I strongly suspect that, as has at times been the case in the past, you would end up with net job losses in the United States. And that's what worries me here, particularly in light of the absence of what I can see as a real national security threat. Only 3 percent of what we're able to produce domestically is what's needed for our national security reasons, and I think that ought to be taken into account.

Sen. Casey. I just want to make a point about—back to 232. I'll focus on steel 232 in Pennsylvania. In your opening, you talked about the job impact, as well as the national security impact, and I'm glad you raised both. I'll just focus on national security.

Sen. Casey. To the extent that you can focus on that, I think the steel executives—the letter they sent you on the 1st of February, I think, outlines the problem. But this really is a national security issue.

Sen. Portman. And that's hurting our ability to continue to have this energy independence we talked about. So those are two specific areas where I do think that there's an opportunity to do something and to use 232, which is a national security, as opposed to 201, which is what President Bush used.

The President. Go ahead, Rick. Representative Erick A. "Rick" Crawford. Thank you, Mr. President. One thing I want to point out, we had the conversation about the national security imperative, and I think we've looked at it in the context of the defense industry.

For the last 8years, deep defense cuts have undermined our national security, hollowed our—and they just—if you look at what's taken out, they've hollowed our readiness as a military unit and put America at really grave risk.
Therefore, as a matter of national security, I've signed this omnibus budget bill. There are a lot of things that I'm unhappy about in this bill. There are a lot of things that we shouldn't have had in this bill, but we were, in a sense, forced—if we want to build our military—we were forced to have. There are some things that we should have in the bill.
Mr. Giuliani. So congratulations. And what you've been doing is keeping your promises, and this is one of your promises. One of your promises was to shore up our country because one of the dangers we face—national security and crime—is cybersecurity. And a large part of our country, unlike other countries, is made up of the private sector. And the private sector is wide open to hacking. And sometimes, by hacking the private sector, you can get into Government.

So here, you're addressing not only a national security problem, but you're addressing the fastest growing form of crime in America, which is cyber theft. It's growing faster than any other crime.

Prime Minister, I pledge to work with you in pursuit of our many shared interests. This includes a stronger trading relationship between the United States and Canada. It includes safe, efficient, and responsible cross-border travel and migration. And it includes close partnership on domestic and international security.

And, Prime Minister Trudeau, you've made very clear that Canada has an open-door policy for Syrian refugees. Do you believe that President Trump's moratorium on immigration has merit on national security grounds?

At the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security. Foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country. And by the way, take a look at what's happening in Europe, folks. Take a look at what's happening in Europe. I took a lot of heat on Sweden. [Laughter] And then, a day later, I said, has anybody reported what's going on?

One of the most important responsibilities for the Federal Government is the budget of the United States. My first budget will be submitted to the Congress next month. This budget will be a public safety and national security budget—very much based on those two—with plenty of other things, but very strong. And it will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it.

And we have just gotten started. Wait until you see what's coming, folks. We've appointed a Supreme Court Justice to replace the late, great Antonin Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. He will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We are proposing a budget that will shrink the bloated Federal bureaucracy—and I mean bloated—while protecting our national security. You see what we're doing with our military: bigger, better, stronger than ever before. You see what's happening. And you're already seeing the results. Our budget calls for one of the single largest increases in defense spending history in this country.

We also recognize that immigration security is national security. We must protect our citizens from those who seek to spread terrorism, extremism, and violence inside our borders. Immigration is a privilege, not a right, and the safety of our citizens must always come first, without question.

Tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, and ignored the urging of the U.N. Security Council.
Paralyzed Veterans of America Executive Director Sherman Gillums, Jr. Well, our Nation will be judged by how it treats its veterans, and the future of our country will rely on generations—right now, they're children, but they're going to be our future servicemen. And so we have to treat veterans well. It's about national security, it's about patriotism, and this is a great step forward to doing that.

Today I'm directing the Department of Commerce to immediately prioritize the investigation it began yesterday and really long before that—because Wilbur and I have been working on this for a long time—into foreign steel arriving into our markets and to submit a report on the effects of these foreign steel products on the national security of the United States. It's not just the pricing, it's not just employment, it also has to do with the national security of our country, which people never talk about. I talk about it.
Maintaining the production of American steel is extremely important to our national security and our defense industrial base. Steel is critical to both our economy and our military. This is not an area where we can afford to become dependent on foreign countries. We have a product where we actually need foreign countries to be nice to us in order to fight for our people. And that's not going to happen any longer, believe me, especially as it comes to steel.
This investigation will look at how steel imports are impacting United States national security, taking into account foreign practices such as steel dumping. Dumping is a tremendous problem in this country. They're dumping vast amounts of steel in our company—in our country, and they're really hurting not only our country, but our companies. Their targeting of American industry and other foreign strategies designed to undermine American industry as a whole. Based on the findings of this report, Secretary Wilbur Ross will make formal recommendations to the White House in a very, very, near future. He'll be back very soon with those recommendations that we will implement.
Let's also remember that immigration security is national security. We've seen the attacks from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino. Hundreds of individuals from other countries have been charged with terrorism-related offenses in the United States.

The Prime Minister and I just finished a productive discussion about the interests of our two countries. Together we discussed crucial issues ranging from national security to trade, to immigration and enhanced economic cooperation. We reaffirmed the tremendous friendship between the United States and Australia and the vital importance of our security and our alliance.

To secure our borders from drug cartels, human smugglers, and terrorist threats, Coast Guard Cutters patrol more than 1,500 miles below our southern border. A lot of people didn't know that. When enormous pride hits your heart, you realize that it's with this great skill and tremendous speed, our Coast Guard men and women interdict dangerous criminals and billions and billions of dollars' worth of illegal narcotics every single year. Your helicopters launch from the decks of world-class national security cutters, and they chase drug smugglers at speeds far in excess of 50 knots.

You have promised to put America First in all that you do, and you've done that in any number of ways, from trade, to national security, to protecting our border, to rightsizing Washington, DC. And today you've put America first with regard to international agreements and the environment.
Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. Mr. President, thank you for the honor to serve the country. It's a great privilege you've given me.

Director of Central Intelligence Michael R. Pompeo. Mr. President, it's an honor to serve as your CIA Director. It's an incredible privilege to lead the men and women who are providing intelligence so that we can do the national security mission. And in the finest traditions at CIA, I'm not going to say a damn thing in front of the media. [Laughter]

Thank you very much for being here to discuss two crucial votes taking place in Congress tomorrow on vital safety and national security legislation.

Before turning to the topic at hand, I want to provide a brief update on two crucial votes taking place this afternoon on the House floor. Very important. These bills are vital to public safety and national security, and I want to thank Chairman Bob Goodlatte for his efforts. Bob has been working very hard and really for a long time, but we got it going.

On Thursday, I am glad to report, these two bills passed the House of Representatives. This represents a crucial step toward ensuring our public safety and national security. I want to thank Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte for his dedicated work on these critical bills, as well as other crucial legislation that will soon be considered as well. I also thank leadership for advancing these lifesaving measures.

But the important leaks to me—and they're leaks that the Attorney General is looking at very strongly—are the leaks coming out of intelligence. And we have to stop them for the security and the national security of our country.

That is why, shortly after my Inauguration, I directed Secretary of Defense Mattis and my national security team to undertake a comprehensive review of all strategic options in Afghanistan and South Asia. My original instinct was to pull out, and historically, I like following my instincts. But all my life, I've heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office, in other words, when you're President of the United States. So I studied Afghanistan in great detail and from every conceivable angle. After many meetings, over many months, we held our final meeting last Friday at Camp David, with my Cabinet and generals, to complete our strategy. I arrived at three fundamental conclusion about America's core interests in Afghanistan.

Immigration security is also a matter—remember this—of national security. That's why we're implementing tough new vetting and screening protocols to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. You look at what just happened in Spain and so many other places. Nope. We're really vetting. We're tough. Does anybody want me to be soft on the vetting, or would you like me——

We also understand that immigration security is a national—it's really a national treasure, but it's a national security. We need national security for safety. We're going to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Sorry. Sorry. Call up some of the other countries in the world, say, "How you doing, folks?" Not so good.
We've also taken historic action to protect our manufacturing and defense industrial base. My administration has ordered a first-ever complete review of the manufacturing technology and supply chains we need to protect our country. We cannot have national security without economic security.

We have many pressing national security issues facing our country. In addition to devastating national disasters, we have had some big natural disasters, and some of you know exactly, because your people have done an incredible job, and I appreciate it.

In a few days, I'll be traveling to Asia to advance America's economic and national security priorities. I am counting on all of you to be back here, working to maintain our momentum on tax reform and tax cuts. And that will be a short period of time—I'll be away for about ten and a half days, and we'll get back very quickly. We're meeting in China, in South Korea, in Japan. We're going to Vietnam. We're going to the Philippines, which is a strategically important location where the previous administration was not exactly welcome, as you probably remember.

This program grants visas not on a basis of merit, but simply because applicants are randomly selected in an annual lottery. And the people put in that lottery are not that country's finest. We know that the program presents significant vulnerabilities to our national security. It's a very unsafe program for our country, and we're not going to allow it to happen, and end that program. So I think Congress will take that up very quickly.
So, in a few days, I'll be traveling to Asia to advance America's economic and national security priorities. I will miss you folks. [Laughter] I will miss everyone at this table. [Laughter]
The United States has been reminded time and time again in recent years that economic security is not merely related to national security, economic security is national security. It is vital—[applause]—to our national strength. We also know that we will not have lasting prosperity if we do not confront grave threats to security, sovereignty, and stability facing our world today.

Upon my Inauguration, I pledged that we would rebuild America, restore its economic strength, and defend its national security. With this goal in mind, I vowed that we would reaffirm old alliances and form new friendships in pursuit of shared goals. Above all, I swore that in every decision, with every action, I would put the best interests of the American people first. Over the past 10 months, traveling across the globe and meeting with world leaders, that is exactly what I have done.

We'll be giving the Cabinet, today, an update on national security and strategy. We'll also receive briefings on the latest developments in the tax cut negotiations. And Administrator McMahon, who's done a fantastic job at Small Business Administration—where's Linda? Linda did a really fantastic job—is helping small businesses in record numbers. And they've needed help, really, because of the hurricanes. The hurricanes were devastating.

Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress not only oppose our efforts to stop illegal immigration and crack down on sanctuary cities, now they are demanding amnesty as a condition for funding the Government, holding troop funding hostage and putting our national security at risk. We cannot allow it.

I'd also like to take a moment today to discuss our immigration system and how we can reform it to make it work for everyday Americans. Our current immigration system helps special interests, but hurts American workers, taxpayers, and national security.

Because these individuals are admitted solely on the basis of family ties—not skill or not merit—most of this immigration is lower skilled, putting great strain on Federal welfare. And because there is no real selection criteria, the current system is totally incompatible with national security.

The second pillar of our strategy is to promote American prosperity. For the first time, American strategy recognizes that economic security is national security. Economic vitality, growth, and prosperity at home is absolutely necessary for American power and influence abroad. Any nation that trades away its prosperity for security will end up losing both. That is why this National Security Strategy emphasizes, more than ever before, the critical steps we must take to ensure the prosperity of our Nation for a long, long time to come. It calls for cutting taxes and rolling back unnecessary regulations. It calls for trade based on the principles of fairness and reciprocity. It calls for firm action against unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. And it calls for new steps to protect our national security industrial and innovation base.

It calls for a total modernization of our military and reversing previous decisions to shrink our Armed Forces, even as threats to national security grew. It calls for streamlining acquisition, eliminating bloated bureaucracy, and massively building up our military, which has the fundamental side benefit of creating millions and millions of jobs.

Senator Daniel S. Sullivan. Well, Mr. President, I want to thank you and your administration. I want to thank Secretary Zinke, who's doing a great job. But Senator Murkowski said it very well, this administration has come in and recognized this incredible, incredible resource that we have in our Nation. Developing our energy is good for jobs, it's good for energy security, it's good for manufacturing, it's good for the environment, because we have the highest standards in the world, and it's very, very good for our foreign policy and national security.

Mr. President, sir, you released your national security strategy just a couple days ago. And in there, you talk about the economy—which is what this tax bill is all about—but you also talk about energy dominance. And I want to thank you. I want to thank you on behalf of all Alaskans and the American people, because it's the right policy. And we're finally, finally doing it.

Morgan: Let's turn to security, national security. You've been very tough on this. You vowed again, in an interview with Good Morning Britain, you were going to hammer ISIS hard. ISIS is now out of Iraq and Syria. I mean, that's a big double success for you, right?

Last year, I directed the Secretary of Commerce to investigate whether steel and aluminum imports are threatening to impair U.S. national security. You see what's happened with our steel and aluminum industries. They're being decimated by dumping and—from many countries, in particular one, but many countries. They're dumping and destroying our industry and destroying the families of workers. And we can't let that happen.

Vice President Michael R. Pence. Well, thank you, Mr. President. I just want to thank all of the Republican and Democrats taking time to be here and their profound issue—profound interest in this issue. To your point, this is about our economy, but it's about national security. And the President directed a 232 review to determine whether or not our national security has been affected by the dumping of steel and aluminum.

And today it is very much the President's desire, our administration's desire, to hear from each of you and the perspectives that will also inform the decisions that the President will make. I think that it is fair to say that we all support national security. I think that's evidenced by the recent budget agreement that the President helped drive, and Republicans and Democrats have supported, for a historic increase in our national defense.

Sen. Toomey. When that's happening. But the 232 is a different matter, and invoking national security, when I think it's really hard to make that case, invites retaliation that will be problematic for us.

And so, even though there may be some job winners from an action like this, I strongly suspect that, as has at times been the case in the past, you would end up with net job losses in the United States. And that's what worries me here, particularly in light of the absence of what I can see as a real national security threat. Only 3 percent of what we're able to produce domestically is what's needed for our national security reasons, and I think that ought to be taken into account.

Sen. Casey. I just want to make a point about—back to 232. I'll focus on steel 232 in Pennsylvania. In your opening, you talked about the job impact, as well as the national security impact, and I'm glad you raised both. I'll just focus on national security.

Sen. Casey. To the extent that you can focus on that, I think the steel executives—the letter they sent you on the 1st of February, I think, outlines the problem. But this really is a national security issue.

Sen. Portman. And that's hurting our ability to continue to have this energy independence we talked about. So those are two specific areas where I do think that there's an opportunity to do something and to use 232, which is a national security, as opposed to 201, which is what President Bush used.

The President. Go ahead, Rick. Representative Erick A. "Rick" Crawford. Thank you, Mr. President. One thing I want to point out, we had the conversation about the national security imperative, and I think we've looked at it in the context of the defense industry.

And we need a level playing field, or we're going to lose our manufacturing infrastructure and the national security issues that surround having a vibrant, capable manufacturing sector.

NOTE: The President spoke at 12:17 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House. In his remarks, Mr. Ferriola referred to Department of Commerce investigations of the effect of imports on national security under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
We've created almost 3 million new jobs since the election. And unemployment claims are at the lowest level in 49 years. Think of that. Unemployment at the lowest level in 49 years. That's a beautiful statistic. We're also taking action to protect American industries that are vital to our national security, including American aluminum and steel. You'll be hearing about that at length at 3:30. Aluminum and steel are the backbone of our Nation. They're the bedrock of our defense industrial base.

A strong steel and aluminum industry are vital to our national security. Absolutely vital. Steel is steel. You don't have steel, you don't have a country. Our industries have been targeted for years and years—decades, in fact—by unfair foreign trade practices leading to the shuttered plants and mills, the laying off of millions of workers, and the decimation of entire communities. And that's going to stop, right? It's going to stop.
Today I'm defending America's national security by placing tariffs on foreign imports of steel and aluminum. We will have a 25-percent tariff on foreign steel and a 10-percent tariff on foreign aluminum when the product comes across our borders. It's a process called dumping. And they dumped more than at any time, on any nation, anywhere in the world. And it drove our plants out of business. It drove our factories out of business. And we want a lot of steel coming into our country, but we want it to be fair, and we want our workers to be protected. And we want, frankly, our companies to be protected.
We're already seeing the national security benefits of this order. Yesterday, in anticipation that we'd be here today, U.S. Steel announced it's reopening a mill in Illinois, a big one, and recalling 500 workers immediately. That's going on all over the country. And by the way, it went on with solar panels, which we did 3 months ago, and washing machines, where they were dumping washing machines all over our country. And now they're expanding plants to make washing machines. We put the tax on it; a lot of you were here.
A skilled, trained workforce in steel is a crucial element of America's national security and must be protected. After the signing of this proclamation, Century Aluminum in Kentucky—Century is a great company—will be investing over $100 million to restart and upgrade their idled military-grade, high-quality aluminum production, which is also critically important to our national security. That's 150,000 additional tons of aluminum. And think of it: This is a closed plant, and now they're doing 150,000 tons production, and an additional 300 workers, and ultimately many more hired in the great State of Kentucky—a package of, sometimes, $90,000 per worker.
For the last 8years, deep defense cuts have undermined our national security, hollowed our—and they just—if you look at what's taken out, they've hollowed our readiness as a military unit and put America at really grave risk.
Therefore, as a matter of national security, I've signed this omnibus budget bill. There are a lot of things that I'm unhappy about in this bill. There are a lot of things that we shouldn't have had in this bill, but we were, in a sense, forced—if we want to build our military—we were forced to have. There are some things that we should have in the bill.
The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons. Establishing this deterrent is a vital national security interest of the United States. The combined American, British, and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power: military, economic, and diplomatic. We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.

[At this point, the President signed a national security Presidential memorandum on ceasing United States participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and taking additional action to counter Iran's malign influence and deny Iran all paths to a nuclear weapon.]

Among the many grave national security blunders of the previous administration, one of the world's worst was the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, a deal that would allow Iran to go right to the brink of nuclear weapons and ultimately very quickly have a nuclear weapon.
As we discuss another critical element of our national security to me, probably one of the reasons we're all here in this great victory celebration, is border security. We have many things to do, but we have already begun the construction of the wall and so many other things are following. We will have those borders extremely strong, extremely powerful, and we will have laws that match the border. [applause] 
Democrats in Congress are also blocking urgently needed improvements to our border security. They don't want border security for two reasons. Number one, they don't care about it. Number two, they are afraid it's going to make me and the Republicans look good, and they don't want that. That comes before our country. They've blocked every effort to close deadly loopholes, to keep out vicious criminals, and to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs. They are a disaster at the border. These actions are endangering our citizens, threatening our communities, and undermining our national security.

We also discussed the issue of uncontrolled migration and the threat that it poses to both national security and other groups and countries and our citizens and quality of life. We're committed to addressing the migration challenge by helping migrants to remain and prosper in their own home countries. A wide array of national security threats were addressed, including the threat of Iran. The G-7 nations remain committed to controlling Iran's nuclear ambitions—with or without them, those ambitions are going to be controlled—along with efforts to combat terrorism and extremism and those who spread this deadly ideology.
The President. They virtually didn't even make that case. I mean, my case is the fact that it is national security; it's our balance sheet; it's our strength. It's absolutely national security. And, you know, if you look at our—just take a look at our balance sheet. We're going to have a very strong balance sheet very soon because of what I'm doing. We have the strongest economy that we've ever had in the United States—in the history of the United States. We have the best unemployment numbers: Black unemployment, the lowest in history; Hispanic unemployment, the lowest in history. I don't mean the lowest in the last 10 years or 20 years. The lowest in the history of this country. Black unemployment is doing the best it's ever done. Hispanic doing the best. Women are now up to 21 years. Soon it's going to be the best ever in its history—in the country's history.
America's vital interest in space lost out to special interests in Washington, except, of course, for the Senators and Congressmen here. They would never do it. Right, Dana? But all of that is changing. We know that. My administration is reclaiming America's heritage as the world's greatest space-faring nation. The essence of the American character is to explore new horizons and to tame new frontiers. But our destiny, beyond the Earth, is not only a matter of national identity, but a matter of national security. So important for our military. So important. And people don't talk about it. When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space. We must have American dominance in space. So important.
Mac, you've been very involved in this issue. Do you have anything to say? Representative William M. "Mac" Thornberry. Well, Mr. President, there are a number of issues that we're going to be able to discuss today that touch on our country's national security. And certainly, controlling who and what comes across our border is an element of national security, as we do the compassionate thing with families.

Vice President Michael R. Pence. Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. And I just—I know I speak for the President when I express the gratitude of this administration for the support of the Members of the Senate and the House that are gathered around here. You've delivered for the American people on national security and rebuilding our military; on tax cuts and regulatory reform, restoring our economy.

And just to finish up, national security, we had $700 billion approved for our military. We had $716 billion approved for next year, for our military. We needed that. I hated the last budget, except I loved what happened to our military. And sometimes, you'll take a little bit of a hit in order to take care of military. Without the military, we're not here. We have the most powerful military that we've ever had—very shortly, on line. We're ordering planes, we're ordering ships, we're ordering a lot of different things. The finest equipment in the world. We make the best equipment.

So the—it's very important to have these mines take place and help revitalize Northeastern Minnesota. And on top of that, it has national security implications. You know? It—really, national security, not just—we don't want to rely on our enemies. But we need to rebuild our infrastructure. And what a great resource to build with our own homegrown materials, homemade materials, and rebuild the infrastructure of America. The President. That's right. Thank you very much.

Heidi was also against us from the very beginning of the travel ban, a common-sense policy to improve our vetting and our national security. And I'm proud to report that, just yesterday, the Supreme Court upheld the travel ban. . . and our authority to keep America safe. [applause]
And it's also coming back for another reason: national security. And your Governor knows very well, and your Senator knows very well what that means with coal. You know, you bomb a pipeline, that's the end of the pipeline. With coal, that stuff is indestructible. [Laughter]

You can move it around on a truck, you can dump it at the plant, you can do whatever the hell—you can rain on top of it for a long time. Right, Jim? It can rain like crazy. You can do whatever you want: snow, sleet, wind. You just dump it. It's there. [Laughter] You hit those pipelines, they're gone, and that's the end of it. You're saying, "Man, we'd better go out and start cutting some lumber." So for national security purposes, I don't think people talk about it enough—coal.

We also recognize the vital importance of border security and immigration control. In order to prevent foreign acts of terrorism within our shores, we must prevent terrorists and their supporters from gaining admission in the first place. Border security is a national security problem. And in the United States, we are working very hard to get the Democrats to give us a couple of votes so we can pass meaningful and powerful border security.

Today, both Russia and the United States face a whole new set of challenges. Those include a dangerous maladjustment of mechanisms for maintaining international security and stability, regional crises, the creeping threats of terrorism and transnational crime. It's the snowballing problems in the economy, environmental risks, and other sets of challenges. We can only cope with these challenges if we join the ranks and work together. Hopefully, we will reach this understanding with our American partners.
As major nuclear powers, we bear special responsibility for maintaining international security. And it made it vital—and we mentioned this during the negotiations—it's crucial that we fine-tune the dialogue on strategic stability and global security and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We submitted our American colleagues a note with a number of specific suggestions.
We also agreed that representatives from our national security councils will meet to follow up on all of the issues we addressed today and to continue the progress we have started right here in Helsinki.
Over the last two decades, nearly two-thirds of American raw steel companies went out of business. More than one-third of the steel jobs vanished. We need steel mills for national security. Remember that. This isn't just price. This isn't just, "Gee, we could do it for a little bit less." We need it for national security. Our steel towns became ghost towns. More than 70,000 hard-working Americans lost their jobs, their hope, and their way of life. You people know it better than anybody.

Four months ago, I stood alongside steel workers just like you, and I announced that to defend our national security, we were placing a 10-percent tariff on foreign aluminum and a 25-percent tariff on foreign steel. That very same week, U.S. Steel announced it was restarting production right here in Granite City and bringing back far more than the original estimate of 500 jobs. A lot more than that now. And just last month, U.S. Steel announced the reopening of the second blast furnace, far ahead of schedule, meaning almost 1,000 jobs. And those are good-paying jobs.

And these tactics—so they're not working, because we're not going to give China or any other country a veto on United States national security. We're not going to do it. And we will not let anybody bully our wonderful American farmers. Our fortunes as a nation rise and fall together, and that is why we are going to stick together and win for our farmers and our factory workers, our steelworkers—here we are—all across this Nation.

Both the Prime Minister and I are focused on the urgent need to protect our nations from terrorism and uncontrolled migration. Our countries have learned through hard experience that border security is national security. They are one and the same.

This new authority will enhance our ability to protect cutting-edge American technology and intellectual property vital to our national security. You've all been reading that intellectual property and all sorts of different things of that nature are being stolen from us by other countries. It's going to be very hard for them to do that. We're putting a lot of safeguards in, and we're doing a lot of things against foreign acquisition of property and especially where they're near sensitive military installations.

Sen. Crapo. Well, first of all, Mr. President, I appreciate the attention that you're bringing to this issue. I don't think that it is well known enough the intensity and the scope of efforts by other nations to steal or to simply outright purchase and access our intellectual property and our technology that's critical for our national security.

And you're right, this legislation updates critical procedures that we have in the United States now, in both our export controls, as well as in our Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to put us on the cutting edge to protect America's technology, intellectual property, and ultimately, our national security. So this is critically important.

They steal the stuff from us, oftentimes innovated through American taxpayer investment, and then they reverse engineer it and use it for their own purposes. Because they seek to replace us in the world—not to be equal to us; to overtake us. And it's almost too late. But finally, someone is standing up to them. And I'm grateful to your administration for making this a priority on every front: on trade, but also on national security.

Senator John Cornyn III. Mr. President, under your administration, we're finally taking the big steps to address the national security threat posed by China, which has grown dramatically, as others have already said. And I believe that China represents the foremost national security and economic challenge to our country of any other country in the world——

But for the sake of our national security, the New York Times should publish his name at once. I think their reporters should go and investigate who it is. That would actually be a good scoop. [applause]
The President. But I will say—I will say this: For somebody to do that is very low and, I think, journalistically and from many different standpoints and maybe even from the standpoint of national security. We'll find out about that. For the New York Times to allow that to happen is disgraceful.

The President. I think so, because I think it's national security. Yes. I would say Jeff should be investigating who the author of that piece was, because I really believe it's national security.

The President. We're going to take a look at what he had, what he gave, what he's talking about—also where he is right now. Supposing I have a high-level national security meeting, and he has got a clearance—I know we talked about clearances a lot, recently—and he goes into a high-level meeting concerning China or Russia or North Korea or something, and this guy goes in. I don't want him at those meetings. So we're going to see what happens. We're looking at it very strongly from a legal standpoint.

We also understand that you can't have national security without border security. Both Poland and the United States understand that strong nations must have very strong borders. The President and I likewise are exploring opportunities to advance energy security. The United States and Poland are deeply committed to energy diversity all across Europe. No nation should be dependent upon a single foreign supplier of energy.

As we know, illicit drugs are linked to organized crime, illegal financial flows, corruption, and terrorism. It's vital for public health and national security that we fight drug addiction and stop all forms of trafficking and smuggling that provide the financial lifeblood for vicious transnational cartels.

Here in the Western Hemisphere, we are committed to maintaining our independence from the encroachment of expansionist foreign powers. It has been the formal policy of our country since President Monroe that we reject the interference of foreign nations in this hemisphere and in our own affairs. The United States has recently strengthened our laws to better screen foreign investments in our country for national security threats and we welcome cooperation with countries in this region and around the world that wish to do the same. You need to do it for your own protection.
A pillar of national security is economic security and trade. National security is not where we lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Over the last 5 years, we've averaged $800 billion-a-year loss on trade. How dumb is that? Eight hundred billion dollars. This group doesn't know about those numbers. I don't even want them to hear those numbers.
But we have to have a strong manufacturing base and manufacturing sector. We need a thriving economy. Those are all, really, essential ingredients to national security. We can't allow what's been happening over the last 25 years to happen.
Another critical element of national security is energy security. And, Rick Perry, you're doing a great job. I'm proud of you. Very proud of you. He was the Governor of Texas for 12 years. He was not only a great Governor, he was a great cheerleader. And he ran for President—he was nasty against me, wasn't he, though? Wow. [Laughter] He was tough. And you're doing great, Rick. We appreciate it very much.

Ms. Hewson. Can I just say that, you know, you make a very important point about how national security also drives economic security. And on the F-35, today, it supports 194,000 jobs across the United States and 1,500 U.S. suppliers.
The United States will continue to deny terrorists any funding, territory, support, or means of infiltrating our country. In this effort, we understand that immigration security is a national security; it's about security as a whole. And that includes our borders that you've been reading so much about over the last long period of time, but especially over the last 2 weeks.

Republicans know that the rule of law is essential to national sovereignty. And we know that immigration enforcement is essential to public safety, national security, and the protection of American jobs, wages, and public benefits. You know that.
And earlier this year, I kept a very crucial promise. To protect our national security, I imposed a 10 percent tariff on foreign aluminum and a 25 percent tariff on foreign steel. And now our steel, aluminum industries are roaring back to life, like nothing you've ever seen. [applause]
All I know is I want to put my miners back to work. And I know it works. And I know--and I know for national security reasons--another reason--coal is something we have to have. We have to have. But they said it's the finest coal in the world. I thought that was great. Might as well tell you. Now I've told you, and I don't feel guilty any longer. But I just want to introduce your next United States Senator from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey. Patrick, come on up. [applause]
WALLACE: You said a lot of things there, let's try to unpack them. There's a lot of talk about staff changes. Your deputy national security advisor was moved out after your wife did something I've never heard of a first lady doing before publicly calling for her removal.
DAWSEY: Mr. President, your national security team is going to the Hill tomorrow to brief senators on Saudi Arabia and Jamal Khashoggi. I've heard from Senator [Lindsey O.] Graham, who I know you were with yesterday, and others, that they want stronger punishment on Saudi Arabia, tougher sanctions. Do you want them to impose that, or do you think that would be deleterious to our — ?
Unfortunately, there are extreme politicians in cities and States around America—I'm sure you haven't heard about this—who have issued policies to forbid their police departments from working with Federal immigration authorities. Hard to believe, isn't it? These outrageous sanctuary cities are grave threats to public safety and national security. Each year, sanctuary cities release thousands of known criminal aliens from their custody and right back into the community. So they put them in, and they have them, and they let them go, and it drives you people a little bit crazy, doesn't it, huh? But it's changing. It's all changing.

No. Look, this is national security we're talking about. You know, just like we talk about the military, just like we're talking about Syria or Afghanistan or all these different places. I mean, we spend in Afghanistan more in 1 month than what we're talking about for the wall. Think of that. Okay? That's another way. We spend in Afghanistan more money than most countries spend, except a few. Okay? It's ridiculous.

The $5.6 billion is such a small number. Literally, it's a month—it's 1 month—in Afghanistan. And we're talking about national security. This isn't just a border, this is national security. This is health and wellness. This is everything.

We mentioned the price that we want—$5.6 billion—very strongly. Because numbers are thrown around—1.6, 2.1, 2.5—this is national security we're talking about. We're not talking about games. We're talking about national security. This should have been done by all of the Presidents that preceded me. And they all know it. Some of them have told me that we should have done it.

The President. Well, we think it can go very quickly. No, we won't be opening until it's solved. We think this is a much bigger problem. The border is a much more dangerous problem. It's a much bigger problem. It's a problem of national security. It's a problem of terrorists.

The President. No, we're looking at a national emergency, because we have a national emergency. Just read the papers. We have a crisis at the border of drugs, of human beings being trafficked all over the world. They're coming through. And we have an absolute crisis, and of criminals and gang members coming through. It is national security. It's a national emergency.

My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation. But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the Government. This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.
The President. I would say that we have a very, very unified party. Mitch has been fantastic. Everybody in that room was fantastic. There was no reason for me even to be there. I knew that before we went. But the Republicans want border security. They want national security. They want to have a steel barrier or a wall of concrete. They don't care. But I'll use any term they want.

So the Republican Party, I can say—and I just left an hour meeting—we had a great time, actually. There was no discussion about anything other than solidarity. We want national security and border security for our country.

And by the way, there's more than one mechanism. There's various mechanisms. And the lawyers tell me a hundred percent. It would be nice if we could make a deal. But dealing with these people is ridiculous. I don't know if they know how to make a deal. It's—we need—and I'll tell you what: A lot of Democrats—I was looking at numbers—a lot of Democrats agree, Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], we need national security. And the only way you have it—the only way you have it is—you have to have a strong border. And the only way you have a strong border is, you need a wall, or you need some kind of a steel—go ahead, Gardiner [Gardiner Harris, New York Times].

The President. We have to get a win, or I'll have to go national security. One or the other.

So I hope that the Democrats get together and work on a problem that is truly—it's compassion, it's everything. It's also national security, just like it's a foreign country, it's a foreign world. In many cases, it is a foreign country. We're under attack in a certain way. And we're certainly under attack by criminal gangs, by criminals themselves, by the human traffickers, and by drugs of all kinds. Much of it comes through the southern border.

Congress has to do its duty, and the Democrats have to help us. They have to come back to Washington, and they have to vote for border security. They have to vote for safety. It's national security too. They have to come back, and they have to vote. It will take us 15 minutes, and then we're going to get on to much bigger immigration reform, because we should do that. We should do that.

The Government remains shutdown for one reason and one reason only: The Democrats will not fund border security, our safety, our national security. People come from many countries.

This morning I also would like to briefly address another matter of critical national security: the humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Without a strong border, America is defenseless, vulnerable, and unprotected. I also want to thank the military for helping us out during the big caravan period. But now you have more caravans forming, and they're on their way up: thousands and thousands of people. We don't know where they're from, who they are, nothing.

THE PRESIDENT: I think what we'll be focusing on will be national security, very much. So we've very largely — we're in the process of rebuilding the military. Which was truly depleted.
THE PRESIDENT: But, uh, I don't believe I've ever met any of the national security — of the people that would do clearances. Um, and there'd be nothing wrong, I don't think, with me calling them up to the Oval Office and say, "Hey give these people, you know, clearances" —
I'll give you an example. So I never met Carter Page. I think to this day I never met Carter Page. I never met Carter Page. [George] Papadopoulos, I never met him, other than one time, where he sat at a table along with maybe 10 or 15 other people, because they wanted to set up a national security team. And I guess he has a certain expertise in national security. So he was at a table very briefly. I don't believe I ever spoke to him. You know there were a lot of people. I was there for a very short period of time. Never met him.
BRENNAN: Do you trust your national security adviser John Bolton because he worked in the Bush administration?

BRENNAN: What would make you use the U.S. military in Venezuela? What's the national security interest?

We must also recognize that immigration security is national security, and that foreign fighters must not gain access into our nations. We've been extremely tough on people that we think can be in any way working with—or even be a part of—radical Islamic terror. I've been very, very tough on that, and I hope every other nation is too.

Today we're here to take a historic step to achieve this goal. In just a few moments, I will sign the national security Presidential memorandum to establish the Women's Global Development and Prosperity initiative, also known as the WGDP. [Laughter] It's a good name. That's one you should remember.
National Security Adviser John R. Bolton. Well, Mr. President, this national security Presidential memorandum that you're about to sign is founded in your National Security Strategy. The ideas that Ivanka has been pursuing here are critical, we think, to the—some of the central pillars of that strategy—very important for the United States to see this development around the world. And it's very exciting. It really is a whole-of-Government approach. And everybody is behind it.
And, Ambassador Bolton and Secretary, thank you for making this a part of your National Security Strategy, Mr. President, because it is a national security issue, and I appreciate that.
So we're going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border. And we're going to do it one way or the other—we have to do it—not because it was a campaign promise, which it is. It was one of many, by the way, not my only one. We're rebuilding the military; our economy is thriving like never before.

That's why my administration has recognized space as a warfighting domain and made the creation of the Space Force a national security priority. I think we'll have great support from Congress, because they do support something when we're talking about such importance. And a lot of the generals, a lot of the people involved have been speaking to Congress. And we have some very interesting dialogue going on.
Vice President Michael R. Pence. We have. Thank you, Mr. President. From the first days of this administration, President Trump has made national security a priority. We've secured historic investments in our national defense. But from very early on, the President also said that America needed to be as dominant in space as we are on the Earth. And now, with this fourth space policy directive, America is leading in space once again.
Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul J. Selva, USAF. Sir, you've been incredibly supportive in bringing space to the fore as not only a domain of potential warfare, but also recognizing it as a place where a large amount of our economic power comes from. And so our job to protect our national security includes protecting our economy as well. And so, as your Vice Chairman, the Joint Chiefs endorse all this effort to make sure that we get the right emphasis on defending our interests and our assets in space.
National Security Adviser John R. Bolton. Well, this is a visionary project, Mr. President—your leadership, the Vice President, and really everybody on the Space Council. This is not something for the next year or two, or even the next 6 years. This is on into the century. A place where, as President Kennedy once said, "I believe space is a new ocean and the United States must sail upon it." And you're taking the steps to make sure that, from the national security perspective, the United States will be dominant on that new ocean.
We have absolute right to do that. I have an absolute right to call national security. We need strong borders. We have to stop drugs and crime and criminals and human trafficking. And we have to stop all of those things that a strong wall will stop. I could call it a barrier, but I think I don't have to do that so much anymore. We'll call it whatever we want. But the point is that we have to have a stoppage. Billions and billions of dollars of illicit things are pouring through our border. And you know, we talk about points of entry, and one of the things that we do have is a lot of money now from points of entry, because everything was given. The money was given—so much that you almost don't know what to do with it—by Congress. But when it came to the wall, they wanted to hold back, because it was politics. That's all it is.
Border Patrol recently reported apprehending 7,000 unlawful migrants in a single week on just one part of the Texas border, a couple of weeks ago. Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point. To confront this national security crisis, last month, I declared a national emergency. A national emergency. And when I see these people—and they're good people—some Senators, mostly—I tell you, the House has been fantastic.
That's why my administration is restoring America's defense industrial base by bringing great jobs and great wages to plants just like this in Lima. Economy and strength is security. And it's all about security and national security. It's about loving our country. It's about loving our flag. You know that.

The despicable attack this morning demonstrates the significant security challenges that Israel faces every single day. And today I am taking historic action to promote Israel's ability to defend itself and, really, to have a very powerful, very strong national security, which they're entitled to have.

Mr. President, now the majority of our agents are assigned to transportation duties, processing duties, and hospital watch. Here at El Centro Sector, that is with a workforce that is approximately 300 agents below the allowed amount. To put things into perspective, approximately 60 agents per day are assigned to these duties. If you look over here, that can go to the preparation of the food, the caring of the unaccompanied children, and the helping of the family units. Those are 60 agents that can and should be patrolling our border. That affects our national security.

Pima County, AZ, Sheriff Mark Napier. Well, good afternoon. I'm Mark Napier. I'm the sheriff for Pima County, Arizona. I am the largest border county in the United States. The strategic deployment of physical barriers along our southern border will always be part of the picture of border security, which is absolutely fundamentally necessary for humanitarian reasons, public safety reasons, and also for national security reasons.

So please do not tell me this is not a public safety crisis, not a humanitarian crisis, and not a national security concern. So this is a very serious issue, and it's time our Government got serious about it. Thank you.

This obstruction does not just hurt families and workers like you, it undermines our independence and national security. The two Executive orders that I'll be signing in just a moment will fix this, dramatically accelerating energy infrastructure approvals. So we're going to get these approvals done quickly. We need help with New York. New York is hurting the country, because they're not allowing us to get those pipelines through, and that's why they're paying so much for their heating and all of the things that energy and our energy produces. So hopefully, they can come on board and get in line with what's happening.

Secure 5G networks will absolutely be a vital link to America's prosperity and national security in the 21st century; 5G will be as much as 100 times faster than the current 4G cellular networks. It will transform the way our citizens work, learn, communicate, and travel. It will make American farms more productive, American manufacturing more competitive, and American health care better and more accessible. Basically, it covers almost everything, when you get right down to it. Pretty amazing.

We know that American energy workers like the ones here at Cameron LNG are the foundation of American strength. That's what you are: the foundation of our strength. As we embrace the potential of our country's God-given abundance, we are also strengthening our national security. By reducing our dependence on foreign sources of energy, we have dramatically increased our power to confront our adversaries, support our friends, and fight for our interests.
Unfortunately, politicians in California, New York, and other States risk our economy and our national security by blocking vital energy resources from being developed and energy infrastructure, like this, from being built. These States could be ports for shipping energy to our friends and allies, but instead of helping our partners, they're hurting America.
To protect our national security, we also impose a 10% tariff on foreign aluminum and a 25% tariff on foreign steel. And what that's done for your aluminum and steel in this country is incredible. Now, just this month, United States Steel announced that it will invest more than $1 billion to completely transform and make new, the Monwah [sic]--you know that? You know where this is? Right, next to Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh! Does anyone know? Mon Valley Works near Pittsburgh is spending over a billion dollars, thousands of jobs, the newest, the finest equipment in the world. They're gonna make steel again in our country. [cheers and applause] They haven't been building new plants for decades. Together we're putting Pennsylvania's steel back into the spine of America. [cheers and applause]
This support for farmers will be paid for by the billions of dollars our Treasury takes in. We'll be taking in, depending on what period of time we're talking, many billions of dollars, far more than the $16 billion that we're talking about. But the $16 billion in funds will help keep our cherished farms thriving and make clear that no country has veto on America's economic and national security. Can't let that happen ever.
In protecting our nations, we also know that the border security is national security.

KERNEN: Mr. President, do you see—while we have you, do you see Huawei as a national security threat or a moving chest piece in the overall trade negotiations with China? What is in your view?
